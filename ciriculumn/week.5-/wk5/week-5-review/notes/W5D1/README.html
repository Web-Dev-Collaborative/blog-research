<h2 id="built-in-node-packages">Built-in Node Packages</h2>
<p>To know what we have access to with built-in node packages, we need to know what node version our environment is running in: - <code>node --version</code> - take a look at the docs: <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/docs/">NodeJS Docs</a></p>
<ul>
<li><code>fs</code> (file system) - reading and writing files</li>
<li><code>path</code> - manipulating file paths</li>
<li><code>readline</code> - reading data from somewhere else (like a file) line-by-line</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="objects-of-interest">Objects of Interest</h3>
<ul>
<li><code>console</code> - the console object</li>
<li><code>process</code> - the object representing the running program</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="intro-to-npm">Intro to <code>npm</code></h2>
<p>What is <code>npm</code>? - <code>npm</code> is a package manager that allows us to use bundled code written by other people and available on the npm online registry - it’s also a <code>cli</code> (command line) tool that we can use to interact with the npm online registry</p>
<p><code>root</code> application folder - contains all your app’s files - includes npm requirements</p>
<p><code>package.json</code> file - exists at the top of the <code>root</code> application folder - contains metadata - info about the project - contains scripts - commonly used commands in the project) - contains dependencies - other packages and their versions that your project relies on - safe to edit but be careful of using <code>json</code> syntax!</p>
<p><code>package-lock.json</code> file - exists at the top of the <code>root</code> application folder - contains exact details about installed dependencies and their versions - represents an exact reproducible npm environment - <strong>do not edit!</strong></p>
<p><code>node_modules</code> folder - includes subdirectories for each dependencies - also includes dependencies of dependencies! Every package you need should be here - Don’t include in git version control system <strong>make sure to .gitignore this folder</strong></p>
<h2 id="npm-commands"><code>npm</code> Commands</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><code>npm</code> will show npm’s help info, including some common commands and how to access more detailed guides.</p></li>
<li><p><code>npm init</code> will set your current project directory up for npm. This requires answering a few questions to generate a <code>package.json</code> file, a critical part of npm’s dependency management functionality. (<code>npm init --y</code> will skip those questions and make a generic <code>package.json</code> for you.)</p></li>
<li><code>npm install</code> will download and install a package into your project. You can use the <code>-g</code> (or <code>--global</code>) flag to install a package for use everywhere on your system.
<ul>
<li>To have some fun, run <code>npm install -g cowsay</code>. Once the download’s completed, try running <code>cowsay Hello, world!</code>.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-npm-installs-packages">How <code>npm</code> installs packages</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>You request the package with <code>npm install {PACKAGE NAME HERE}</code>.</li>
<li>The npm CLI tool updates your <code>package.json</code> file to include the package as a dependency and requests the package from the npm registry.</li>
<li>npm downloads the package and installs it to the <code>node_modules</code>folder in your current directory (one will be created if it’s not already there). It chooses the most recent version by default.</li>
<li>npm creates a <code>package-lock.json</code> file that includes where the installed package is located and exactly which version was used.</li>
<li>You’re all set! You can now <code>require('your-package-name-here');</code> anywhere in your project.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="gitignore"><code>.gitignore</code></h2>
<p>A <code>.gitignore</code> file allows us to tell <code>git</code> which files and directories to never include in our working directory and to never commit to our git logs.</p>
<p>The <code>node_modules</code> folder created by <code>npm install</code> contains massive amounts of files that we don’t want to be committing and tracking. - <code>npm</code> is a version-controlled package manager already so we don’t need to track changes to the code in the <code>node_modules</code> folder. - We only need to commit the versions of the packages we are using specified in the <code>package.json</code> and the <code>package-lock.json</code> files.</p>
<h2 id="npm-lesson-learning-objectives"><code>npm</code> Lesson Learning Objectives</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>Explain what “npm” stands for.</li>
<li>Explain the purpose of the package.json file and node_modules directory.</li>
<li>Given multiple choices, identify the difference between npm’s package.json and package-lock.json files.</li>
<li>Use npm –version to check what version is currently installed and use npm to update itself to the latest version.</li>
<li>Use npm init to create a new package and npm install to add a package as a dependency. Then use require to import the module and utilize it in a JavaScript file.</li>
<li>Explain the difference between a dependency and a development dependency.</li>
<li>Given an existing GitHub repository, clone the repo and use npm to install it’s dependencies.</li>
</ol>
