<h2 id="the-three-pillars-of-object-oriented-programming">The Three Pillars of Object Oriented Programming</h2>
<ul>
<li>encapsulation - objects should “mind their own business”</li>
<li>inheritance - each object is an instance of its class or prototype, as well as all ancestor classes or prototypes</li>
<li>polymorphism - each object/class/prototype can be assigned attributes and methods that extend the behavior of its ancestors</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-solid-principles">The SOLID Principles</h2>
<p>(see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID">SOLID</a>)</p>
<ul>
<li>S - Single-Responsibility Principle - <em>do one thing, and do it right</em></li>
<li>O - Open-Closed Principle - <em>software should be open to extension, but closed to modification</em></li>
<li>L - Liskov Substitution Principle - <em>objects should be replaceable with their subtypes</em></li>
<li>I - Interface Segregation Principle - <em>many client-specific interfaces are better than one general purpose interface</em></li>
<li>D - Dependency Inversion Principle - <em>one should depend upon abstractions, not concretions</em></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-to-apply-the-law-of-demeter">How to Apply the Law of Demeter</h2>
<p><em>A method of an object can only invoke the methods (or use the properties) of the following kinds of objects:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>methods on the object itself</li>
<li>any of the objects passed in as parameters to the method</li>
<li>any object created in the method</li>
<li>any values stored in the instance variables of the object</li>
<li>any values stored in global variables</li>
</ul>
<p>NOTE: This is certainly a good general principle - however there are situations where it is appropriately violated egregiously, most particularly when one uses an ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) like SQL Alchemy or the Django ORM to express complex queries in procedural language. In those situations, you may legitimately be asking questions about the <code>player.medication</code> related to the <code>player.team.physician.specialty</code>.</p>
