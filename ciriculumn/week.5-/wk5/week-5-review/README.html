<h1 id="week-5-study-suggestions">WEEK 5 STUDY SUGGESTIONS</h1>
<p>Here is a suggested outline for studying this weekend:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Fill In Learning Objective Document
<ul>
<li>first: fill out the empty LO document on your own (<code>LOs-empty.md</code>)</li>
<li>then: compare your document with the filled out version (<code>LOs-explained.md</code>)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Review Weekly Notes
<ul>
<li>additional notes on each days’ topics can be found in the <code>notes</code> directory</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Review the warmup exercises in the <code>warmups</code> directory
<ul>
<li>inside you will find both of the warmup exercises we worked on this week
<ul>
<li>instructions for each can be found in their respective <code>README.md</code> files</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="assessment-format">ASSESSMENT FORMAT</h1>
<ul>
<li>Multiple Choice x10</li>
<li>Online Coding Environment x2</li>
<li>VSCode Questions
<ul>
<li>Four .js files that you’ll have to code in</li>
<li>Pass the mocha specs for each file (17 specs total)</li>
<li>We will use CommonJS for requiring/exporting files
<ul>
<li>We will use <code>module.exports = ClassName</code>, <code>module.exports = { ClassName }</code>, or <code>exports.ClassName = ClassName</code> for exporting. Know the differences and how to use each.</li>
<li>We will use <code>const ClassName = require('./file/path')</code> or <code>const { ClassName } = require('./file/path')</code> for importing. Know the differences and how to use each.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>ES Modules import/export syntax (like what is used in Connect Four) is important for you to know moving forward in the curriculum; it is what allows us to import files in a browser environment. However, you will not be writing it on the assessment as we will only be running specs in a Node environment, where CommonJS is still the default.
<ul>
<li>Fun fact: ES6 Modules are an experimental feature in Node. Maybe one day they’ll take over as the default! :fingers-crossed:</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
