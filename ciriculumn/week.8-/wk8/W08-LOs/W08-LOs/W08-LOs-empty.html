<h2 id="assessment-structure">Assessment Structure</h2>
<ul>
<li>1 hour, 40 minutes</li>
<li>Mixture of multiple choice (15-20), free response (1-3) and VSCode (1-3) problems, each with multiple specs.
<ul>
<li>Free response just requires enough detail to answer the question, 1-3 sentences. As long as you are able to explain the concept and answer all aspects that it asks, you are good.</li>
<li>Coding problems will have specs to run (<code>npm test</code>) and check your work against</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Standard assessment procedures
<ul>
<li>You will be in an individual breakout room</li>
<li>Use a single monitor and share your screen</li>
<li>Only have open those resources needed to complete the assessment:
<ul>
<li>Zoom</li>
<li>VSCode</li>
<li>Browser with AAO and Progress Tracker (to ask questions)</li>
<li>Approved Resources for this assessment:</li>
