<h1 id="binary-search-tree-project">Binary Search Tree Project</h1>
<p>This project contains a skeleton for you to implement a binary search tree. This is a test-driven project. Run the tests and read the top-most error. If itâ€™s not clear what is failing, open the <strong>test/test.js</strong> file to figure out what the test is expecting. Make the top-most test pass.</p>
<p>Keep making the top-most test pass until all tests pass.</p>
<h2 id="instructions">Instructions</h2>
<ul>
<li>Clone the project from https://github.com/appacademy-starters/data-structures-binary-search-tree-starter.</li>
<li><code>cd</code> into the project folder</li>
<li><code>npm install</code> to install dependencies in the project root directory</li>
<li><code>npm test</code> to run the specs</li>
<li>You can view the test cases in <code>test/test.js</code>. Your job is to write code in
<ul>
<li><strong>lib/bst.js</strong> to implement the <code>BST</code> class</li>
<li><strong>lib/leet_code_108.js</strong> as a scratch pad to work on the LeetCode.com problem at https://leetcode.com/problems/convert-sorted-array-to-binary-search-tree/</li>
<li><strong>lib/leet_code_110.js</strong> as a scratch pad to work on the LeetCode.com problem at https://leetcode.com/problems/balanced-binary-tree/</li>
</ul></li>
