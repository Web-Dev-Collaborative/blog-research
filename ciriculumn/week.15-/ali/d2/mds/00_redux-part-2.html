<p>To keep things as simple as possible when initially learning Redux, you started with using Redux independent of React. Now itâ€™s time to learn how to use Redux within a React application!</p>
<p>After reading and practicing how to use Redux with React, you should be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add Redux actions, reducer(s), and a store to a React project</li>
<li>Update a React class component to subscribe to a Redux store to listen for state changes</li>
<li>Update a React component to dispatch actions to a Redux store</li>
<li>Define multiple reducers to manage individual slices of state</li>
<li>Use the Redux <code>combineReducers</code> method to combine multiple reducers into a single root reducer</li>
<li>Update a reducer to delegate a state update to a subordinate reducer</li>
<li>Describe how container components differ from presentational components</li>
<li>Write a container component to handle all of the Redux store interaction for one or more presentational components</li>
<li>Use <code>Object.freeze</code> to prevent the current state within a reducer from being mutated</li>
<li>Create a Redux store with preloaded state</li>
</ul>
