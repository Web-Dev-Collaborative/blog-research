<p>You’ve been using React’s Context API to manage global state to share the same information across multiple components. Redux, like Context, gives you a way to store and manage global state in your React applications. Even though Context has become a popular option since its introduction, Redux remains a popular option for projects with sophisticated global state requirements.</p>
<p>After reading and practicing how to use Redux, you should be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Describe the Redux data cycle</li>
<li>Describe the role of the store in the Redux architecture</li>
<li>Explain what a <em>reducer</em> is</li>
<li>Use the <code>createStore</code> method to create an instance of a Redux store</li>
<li>Use the <code>store.dispatch</code> method to dispatch an action to trigger a state update</li>
<li>Use the <code>store.subscribe</code> method to listen for state updates</li>
<li>Use the <code>store.getState</code> method to get the current state</li>
<li>Use a <code>switch</code> statement within a reducer function to handle multiple action types</li>
<li>Describe why it’s important for a reducer to avoid mutating the current state when creating the next state</li>
<li>Write an action creator function to facilitate in the creation of action objects</li>
<li>Use constants to define action types to prevent simple typos in action type string literals</li>
</ul>
