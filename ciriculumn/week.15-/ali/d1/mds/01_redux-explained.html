<h1 id="redux-explained">Redux Explained</h1>
<p>Redux is a JavaScript framework for managing the frontend state of a web application. It allows us to store information in an organized manner in a web app and to quickly retrieve that information from anywhere in the app. Redux is modeled on a few previous web technologies including <a href="http://elm-lang.org/docs">Elm</a> and <a href="https://facebook.github.io/flux/docs/overview.html#content">Flux</a>.</p>
<p>Advantages of Redux include:</p>
<ul>
<li>It simplifies some of the more cumbersome aspects of Flux</li>
<li>It is very lightweight; the library only takes up 2 kbs</li>
<li>It is very fast (the time to insert or retrieve data is low)</li>
<li>It is predictable (interacting with the data store in the same way repeatedly will produce the same effect)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="where-did-redux-come-from">Where did Redux come from?</h2>
<p>Redux was created by Dan Abramov in 2015. It was initially intended as an experiment to create a simplified version of Flux. Abramov wanted to remove some of what he saw as the unnecessary boilerplate code that was required to create a Flux app.</p>
<p>Abramov also wanted to eliminate some of the aspects of development he found frustrating. When trying to debug a web app, one must often go through the series of steps that cause the bug to occur each time the code is changed. This quickly becomes repetitive and frustrating. Abramov envisioned dev tools that would allow one to undo or replay a series of actions at the click of a button. This idea became the Redux DevTools.</p>
<p>The reason this works is that Redux updates the state using pure functions called reducers (see below for definitions), so one can simply replay a series of actions and be guaranteed to arrive at the same final state. As Redux was developed it also became more convenient to use a single object to store the state, as opposed to traditional Flux which uses multiple stores.</p>
<p>These design choices allowed for the creation of an ecosystem of powerful Redux tools and extensions. Over time three principles were recognized as central to the philosophy of Redux. They are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>A Single Source of Truth</strong> The state for an entire Redux app is stored in a single, plain JavaScript object.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>State is Read Only</strong> The state object cannot be directly modified. Instead it is modified by dispatching actions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Changes Are Made with Pure Functions</strong> The reducers that receive the actions and return updated state are pure functions of the old state and the action.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Beyond this, a guiding meta-philosophy of Redux is the idea that in a software library restrictions can be just as important as features. Redux deliberately places significant restrictions on the way state can be stored and updated, but in return it allows easy implementation of a number of powerful features that would be extremely difficult to write using a less restrictive framework.</p>
<h2 id="when-is-it-appropriate-to-use-redux">When is it appropriate to use Redux?</h2>
<p>Initially, Redux grew in popularity, quickly moving beyond its initial plan as an experiment. As of early 2016 it had over 3,000,000 downloads. The Redux repository on GitHub has over 50,000 stars, and Redux is now used by a number of companies including Exana, Patreon, and ClassPass.</p>
<p>Since the introduction of Redux, Context has been added to React. Context, like Redux, gives you a way to store and manage global state in your React applications. For projects with simpler global state requirements, Context has become a popular alternative to using Redux.</p>
<p>Context is built into React so there’s no need to install an additional library as a dependency. Context is also simpler overall and generally requires less work to get up and running. All that being said, for projects with more sophisticated global state requirements, Redux remains a popular option. Redux offers greater flexibility with support for middleware and richer developer tools in the form of the Redux DevTools.</p>
<h2 id="vocabulary">Vocabulary</h2>
<p>Learning how to use Redux requires you to understand a fair amount of terminology. For now, don’t worry about memorizing all of the following terms; it’s good enough to just have a general awareness. You’ll revisit each of these terms as you work your way through this lesson.</p>
<h3 id="state">State</h3>
<p>Ex: “<em>Redux is a state manager.</em>”</p>
<p>The <em>state</em> of a program means all the information stored by that program at a particular point in time. It is generally used to refer to the data stored by the program at a particular instance in time, as opposed to the logic of the program, which doesn’t change over time. The job of Redux is to store the state of your app and make it available to entire app.</p>
<h3 id="store">Store</h3>
<p>Ex: “<em>Redux stores state in a single store.</em>”</p>
<p>The Redux store is a single JavaScript object with a few methods, including <code>getState</code>, <code>dispatch(action)</code>, and <code>subscribe(listener)</code>. Any state you want Redux to handle is held in the store.</p>
<h3 id="actions">Actions</h3>
<p>Ex: “<em>The Redux store is updated by dispatching actions.</em>”</p>
<p>An action is a POJO (plain old JavaScript object) with a <code>type</code> property. Actions contain information that can be used to update the store. They can be <em>dispatched</em>, i.e. sent to the store, in response to user actions or AJAX requests. Typically Redux apps use functions called <em>action creators</em> that return actions. Action creators can take arguments which allow them to customize the data contained in the actions they generate.</p>
<h3 id="pure-functions">Pure functions</h3>
<p>Ex: “<em>Redux reducers are pure functions.</em>”</p>
<p>A function is pure if its behavior depends only on its arguments and it has no side effects. This means the function can’t depend on the value of any variables that aren’t passed to it as arguments, and it can’t alter the state of the program or any variable existing outside itself. It simply takes in arguments and returns a value.</p>
<h3 id="reducer">Reducer</h3>
<p>Ex: “<em>Redux handles actions using reducers.</em>”</p>
<p>A reducer is a function that is called each time an action is dispatched. The reducer receives an action and the current state as arguments and returns an updated state.</p>
<p>Redux reducers are required to be pure functions of the dispatched action and the current state. This makes their behavior very predictable and allows their effects to potentially be reversed.</p>
<h3 id="middleware">Middleware</h3>
<p>Ex: “<em>You can customize your response to dispatched actions using middleware.</em>”</p>
<p>Middleware is an optional component of Redux that allows custom responses to dispatched actions. When an action is dispatched, it passes through each middleware that has been added to the state. The middleware can do something in response and choose whether or not to pass the action on down the chain. Behind the scenes, the middleware actually replaces the dispatch method of the store with a customized version. There is a large ecosystem of existing middleware ready to be plugged into any Redux projects. One example is a logger that records each action before passing it on to the reducer. Perhaps the most common use for middleware is to dispatch asynchronous requests to a server.</p>
<h3 id="time-traveling-dev-tools">Time traveling dev tools</h3>
<p>Ex: “<em>Redux has time traveling dev tools.</em>”</p>
<p>Redux reducers are pure functions of the dispatched action and the current state. This means that if one were to store a list of the previous states over time and the actions that had been dispatched, one could retroactively cancel an action and recalculate the state as if that action had never been dispatched. This is precisely the functionality that the Redux DevTools provide. The dev tools can be added as middleware to any Redux project. They allow you to look back through the history of the state and toggle past actions on and off to see a live recalculation of the state. This ability to revert to a previous state is what is meant by time travel.</p>
<h3 id="thunks">Thunks</h3>
<p>Ex: “<em>Thunks are a convenient format for taking asynchronous actions in Redux.</em>”</p>
<p>The traditional approach to middleware closely parallels the format of reducers. The actions being dispatched are POJOs with types and various middleware files are waiting to receive them. These files check the type of the action using a case statement just like reducers.</p>
<p>Thunks are an alternative approach. A thunk is a general concept in computer science referring to a function whose primary purpose is simply to call another function. In Redux a thunk action creator returns a function rather than an object. When they are dispatched, thunk actions are intercepted by a piece of middleware that simply checks if each action is a function. If it is, that function is called with the state and dispatch as arguments, otherwise it is passed on down the chain. Thunks are most commonly used to make asynchronous API requests.</p>
