<h2 id="define-multiple-reducers-for-each-slice-of-state">Define Multiple Reducers for Each Slice of State</h2>
<ul>
<li>Each reducer is composed of only one slice of state (ex: farmer, fruit) ## Combining Reducers</li>
<li><code>combineReducers</code>
<ul>
<li>import each reducer into a <code>rootReducer</code> file</li>
<li>create and export your <code>rootReducer</code></li>
<li>set your rootReducer to be equal to the return value of the Redux <code>combineReducers</code> function when it is invoked with an object as its argument.
<ul>
<li>The keys of this object are the names of your slices of state</li>
<li>The values of this object is your reducer for this slice ## Destructure the state object in your components ## Subordinate Reducers</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Shallow vs.Â Deep Copy</li>
<li>For each layer of the state, you could create a subordinate reducer to freeze/duplicate that layer and create another layer of the nextState without manipulating your current state</li>
<li><code>Object.freeze()</code> is great, but also just shallow! ## REVIEW: Redux Workflow with Multiple Reducers</li>
<li>Create and export the store (do this once!)</li>
<li>Repeat the following for each feature of your application
<ol type="1">
<li>Create and export Action(s)</li>
<li>Create and export Reducer
<ul>
<li>Create a subordinate reducer if necessary</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Add Reducer to rootReducer</li>
<li>Components (The component flow changes when you add in container components which interact with redux for the presentational componenets)
<ul>
<li>Subscribe/unsubscribe components to your store</li>
<li>Access the correct slice of state for your component</li>
<li>Import and add dispatches to your actions in your components.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol></li>
</ul>
