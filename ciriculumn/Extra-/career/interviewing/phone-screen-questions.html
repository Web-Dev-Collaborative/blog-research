<h1 id="technical-phone-screen-questions">Technical Phone Screen Questions</h1>
<p>Although less common now that there are cheaper automated code challenges companies can use, it is still common for a company who likes your resume to schedule a short phone interview with you, called a “phone screen.” The main purpose of this is to screen out candidates who have exaggerated their resume and don’t have basic competency and/or poor communication skills. It is a guard against wasting the interviewing team’s time on someone who is unlikely to make it through the rest of the interview process.</p>
<h2 id="language-quiz">Language Quiz</h2>
<p>A common component of a phone screen is a quick “language quiz” question. Sometimes these are even asked by non-technical recruiters who don’t really know the answer themselves but write down your answer on behalf of the engineering team. They are meant to separate candidates who claim they know X and usually center around something tricky about the language/tool but that is not obscure. <strong>You should have a clear and concise answer to these at your fingertips.</strong></p>
