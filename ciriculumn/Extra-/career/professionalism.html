<p>Importance to professionalism in workplace:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creates Boundaries – Workers who conduct themselves professionally avoid crossing their line with subordinates, superiors or clients</li>
<li>Creates an Atmosphere of Improvement – A professional atmosphere is more conducive to success.</li>
<li>The sense of Responsibility – In a professional atmosphere, an employee while handling a task, sees the larger purpose, and hence are able to own their actions and take appropriate decisions. One takes pride in performing the tasks assigned to them. This adds to the overall image of not only the employee but also showcases the value by which the organisation stands.</li>
<li>Mitigates Conflicts – businesses which promote a professional atmosphere also makes it easier to deal with diverse environments in which subordinates or even clients could have a difference of opinion however they can agree to disagree and come together on common grounds.</li>
<li>Increased Job Satisfaction – Professionalism eliminates stress to a great degree and once that is taken care of an employee thrives in a healthy atmosphere leading to enhanced performance.</li>
<li>Personal Growth – Not only in terms of job advancement, but there are a certain dignity and pride in one’s work that develops. You get appreciated for consistently good quality output and that in turn builds your confidence, makes you a more secure person who is then capable of handling difficult situations with refined emotional maturity. <a href="https://imarticus.org/professionalism-important-workplace/">(imarticus.org)</a></li>

<h3 id="common-mistakes-misconceptions">Common Mistakes / Misconceptions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>“This is irrelevant to me right now because I’m an apprentice. I’ll start acting professionally once I’m hired.”</strong> Many serious athletes “practice like they play”, meaning they approach their practice and training with as much seriousness and intensity as they’d put in during a real game. This makes them well-prepared for game days. Techtonica has a similar approach, and we expect apprentices to “practice like they play”.</li>
<li><strong>“If someone tells me to behave professionally, they are telling me to act more like an higher-income white person.”</strong> If someone tells you to behave more professionally, they are referring to the (sometimes unwritten) behaviors outlined in this lesson. These behaviors are generally accepted across industries, roles and employment types to be “professional”.</li>
<li><strong>“Behaving professionally makes me appear weak.”</strong> Behaving professionally demonstrates that you value your role, your team, your employer and are conscientious.</li>
<li><strong>“I cannot be my authentic self and behave professionally.”</strong> Being yourself and behaving professionally are not mutually exclusive. Sometimes, the “professional” you is one part of your true self who gets to come out at work, while other parts of your true self get to come out at other times.</li>
<li><strong>“It won’t matter what I do or how I act because I’ll just be a junior software engineer after Techtonica.”</strong> Junior software engineers are valued team members and are held to the same standard of professionalism as everyone else at the company. Behaving professionally demonstrates that you value your role, your team, your employer and are conscientious. Start your reputation off on good footing.</li>
