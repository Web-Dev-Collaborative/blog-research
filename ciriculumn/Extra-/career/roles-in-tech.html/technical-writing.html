<p><em>Here are some of the common mistakes Technical Writers do-</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Messy Structure</strong> : Many technical documents confuse readers and fail to achieve their aims because they were not planned properly to begin with.</li>
<li><strong>Poor punctuation</strong> : All writers have a passing knowledge of the main set of punctuation marks. Very few, however, outside of professional authors and editors, have a thorough grasp of how each one works.</li>
<li><strong>Too much abstraction</strong> : People writing in a formal or semi-formal context often go overboard in an effort to make their prose sound proper and elevated.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>A few misconceptions regarding Technical Writing are as follows-</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Technical writers simply write a user manual. It is called by various fancy names for different products</li>
<li>Technical documentation is an insignificant part of product development.</li>
<li>It is enough to document key features of the product. Small things, the users can figure out themselves.</li>
