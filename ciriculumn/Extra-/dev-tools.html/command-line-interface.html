<ul>
<li>It is a more efficient way of accessing the computer’s capabilities.</li>
<li>Many software libraries and tools can only be downloaded via the Command Line (such as <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">Node Package Manager (npm)</a>).</li>
<li>Error messages will often print out to the Command Line.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Which companies use the Command Line?</strong> Every company will expect you to be able to navigate the Command Line.</p>
<h4 id="looking-at-an-example-website">Looking at an example website</h4>
<ul>
<li>Sometimes you will see instructions on a website, and there will be a dollar sign followed by text, like so:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>$ cd Downloads/</code></pre>
<h3 id="installation-and-set-up-zsh">Installation and Set Up zsh</h3>
<p>If you recently purchased a Mac with the latest operating system, <strong>Catalina</strong>, <em>zsh</em> is already installed by default. You can check your current default shell by entering the command below:</p>
<pre><code>echo $SHELL</code></pre>
<p>If the result turns out to be <code>/bin/zsh</code>, then you already have <em>zsh</em> set as your default shell. If not, you can change your default shell using the <code>chsh</code> command:</p>
<pre><code>chsh -s /bin/zsh</code></pre>
<p>When prompted, enter your password. Log off your terminal and log back on for the changes to apply.</p>
<p>If you do not have <em>zsh</em> installed yet, you can install it using Homebrew.</p>
<p>If you have <a href="http://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a> installed, use this command:</p>
<pre><code>brew install zsh</code></pre>
<h4 id="installing-homebrew">Installing Homebrew</h4>
<p>If your system does not have Homebrew installed, you need to have <strong>Xcode</strong> installed first. To check and see if you have Xcode installed, enter the following in the Terminal:</p>
<pre><code>spctl --assess --verbose /Applications/Xcode.app</code></pre>
<p>The results should have one of these messages appear:</p>
<pre><code>/Applications/Xcode.app: accepted
source=Mac App Store

/Applications/Xcode.app: accepted
source=Apple

/Applications/Xcode.app: accepted
source=Apple System</code></pre>
<p>If the results are anything else other than the above three, you can install Xcode from the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12">Mac App Store</a>. Once you have <em>XCode</em> installed, you can install Homebrew by entering this in the Terminal below:</p>
<pre><code>ruby -e &quot;$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)&quot;</code></pre>
<p>You can also check that Homebrew is installed by accessing their help section:</p>
<pre><code>brew help</code></pre>
<h4 id="installing-zsh">Installing zsh</h4>
<p>With both XCode and Homebrew installed, you can install <em>zsh</em> with the following command:</p>
<pre><code>brew install zsh</code></pre>
<p>After installation, you can set <em>zsh</em> as your default shell with the command below:</p>
<pre><code>chsh -s /bin/zsh</code></pre>
<p>Lastly, log out of your Terminal and log back in. You can check again to be sure that <em>zsh</em> is your default shell:</p>
<pre><code>echo $SHELL</code></pre>
<p>The result should give you the default shell the Terminal was set up and shell’s current version installed.</p>

<h3 id="demonstration">Demonstration</h3>
<p>Instructor demonstrates how to use many of the above commands in the video walkthrough of the lesson slides.</p>
<h3 id="common-mistakes-misconceptions">Common Mistakes / Misconceptions</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>“I have always just downloaded everything I need with my mouse. I don’t need to use the CLI.”</strong> As you continue programming, you will learn new languages and tools. There are some important tools out there that can only be accessed via CLI. One example is NPM (node package manager), which we’ll use in a few weeks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>“I am afraid of getting into the wrong directory. Isn’t it easier to just click and type?”</strong> There are simple commands you can run in the CLI to check which directory you’re in. Once you get into the habit of using the CLI, you can quickly navigate through files and directories without leaving the keyboard, greatly increasing speed and efficiency.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>“What if I accidentally delete important directories or files that affect my computer’s operations?”</strong> Most files and directories for computer operation are protected in some way. They could be hidden or have higher permission settings. Hidden files, for example, have a dot in front of their file name, and you can’t see them without certain commands or special settings. If you are editing such files and you don’t know why, please check with the instructor.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="a-note-about-naming-files-and-folders">A note about naming files and folders</h3>
<pre><code>helloThisIsCamelCase becauseCamelsHaveHumps
this_is_snake_case there_are_snake_friends_between_words
this-is-kebab-case it-looks-like-the-words-are-stuck-on-kebabs</code></pre>
<p>We use camelCase in JavaScript! We tend to use snake_case.html for filenames on Unix &amp; Linux systems. We tend to use kebab-case for directory (folder) names and git repository names.</p>
<h3 id="independent-practice">Independent Practice</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Navigate to your Desktop. Create a directory named “foo”. Use <code>cd foo</code> to navigate into “foo” and create another directory named “bar”.</p></li>
<li><p>Run <code>cd bar</code>. What directory are you in now? Check by running <code>pwd</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Run <code>cd ../</code>. What directory do you think you are in now? Check by running <code>pwd</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Navigate back to the “bar” directory and run <code>touch first.txt</code> and <code>touch ../second.txt</code>. You have not <code>cd</code>’d into the “foo” directory, but your second command contained <code>../</code>. Can you guess where <code>second.txt</code> is located?</p></li>
<li><p>Check your answer by running <code>ls</code> inside both the “foo” and the “bar” directory. The <code>second.txt</code> file should be inside the “foo” directory.</p></li>
<li><p>Navigate into the “bar” directory. Run <code>cp first.txt ../</code>. Use <code>ls</code> and make sure both directories have a <code>first.txt</code> file.</p></li>
<li><p>Navigate back into the “foo” directory. Run <code>mv second.txt foofile.txt</code>, then run <code>ls</code>. What happened to “second.txt”?</p></li>
<li><p>Use <code>TAB key</code> to autocomplete the names of directories and files while in the command line faster as it’ll autocomplete the string as far as it can before you have to disambiguate. Hit the tab twice to see the list of <strong>autocomplete possibilities</strong> (if multiple matches).</p></li>
<li><p>The root directory is the directory that contains all other directories and files on the system and which is designated by a forward slash ( / ). Root is the very top directory of the directory tree diagram. The root directory of a GitHub project is the top most directory of your git project which contains all the files hosted on GitHub.</p></li>
<li><p>You can immediately open whatever folder or directory you are working within into the Finder of MacOS and Mac OS X by simply typing <code>open .</code> and executing it<br />
<code>open</code> is not magically connected to Mac’s Finder, but actually it’s just using whatever default program on your Mac opens a file with that extension, and in the case of directories, the default program is Finder.</p></li>
<li><p>Another Mac shortcut <code>cmd+ shift+ g</code> can be used anywhere you see a Finder window (even in other Mac programs such as SourceTree or VSCode when you’re opening a file or directory). This brings up a little text box into which you can type or paste a path. Use <code>pwd</code> to get your current path, then copy it from the terminal and open up SourceTree, go to file &gt; open, then use <code>cmd + shift + g</code> to paste in the path you want.</p></li>
<li><p><code>ls</code> command is used to peek into other folders. The list of ls arguments are <code>ls -l</code> : shows file or directory, size, modified date and time, file or folder name and owner of file and its permission. <code>ls -a</code> : lists all the files including hidden files. <code>ls -lh</code>: shows sizes in human readable format.</p></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="cd-commands">cd commands</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>To navigate to your home directory, use “cd” or <code>cd ~</code></li>
<li>To navigate up one directory level, use <code>cd ..</code></li>
<li>To navigate to the previous directory (or back), use <code>cd -</code></li>
<li>To navigate into the root directory, use <code>cd /</code></li>
<li>To navigate through multiple levels of directory at once, specify the full directory path that you want to go to. For example, use <code>cd ~/OFGT-data/images</code> to go directly to the images subdirectory in the OFGT-data folder. As another example, <code>cd ~/Desktop</code> will move you to the Desktop subdirectory inside your home directory.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="absolute-path-vs-relative-path">Absolute Path vs Relative Path</h3>
<h4 id="absolute-path"><strong>absolute path</strong></h4>
<ol type="1">
<li>Start at the root directory ( / ) and work down.</li>
<li>Write a slash ( / ) after every directory name (last one is optional) For Example: <code>cat /home/kt/abc.sql</code></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="relative-path"><strong>relative path</strong></h4>
<ol type="1">
<li>Relative path is defined as the path related to the present working directly(pwd).</li>
<li><p>It starts at your current directory and never starts with a ( / ). For Example:</p>
<pre><code>$pwd
   /home/kt
   $cd abc</code></pre></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="challenge">Challenge</h3>
<p>Run the <code>ls -l</code> command in the “foo” directory and compare it to the outcome of just running the <code>ls</code> command. The output from <code>ls -l</code> is different – how?</p>
<p>Next, run <code>man ls</code>. Scroll to the bolded title “The Long Format”. The first few paragraphs talk about what <code>-l</code> displays. Look for the one that starts with “The file mode…”. Read it and see if your guess is correct.</p>
<p>Scroll through the manual and see if you can get an idea of what the format of a manual is typically like. Feel free to check out the manual for some of the command above. Whenever you are done, type <code>q</code> to exit.</p>

<h4 id="configure-your-terminal-with-oh-my-zsh-optional">Configure your Terminal with Oh My ZSH (Optional)</h4>
<p><a href="https://ohmyz.sh/">Oh My ZSH</a> is a framework created specifically for configuring and customizing <em>zsh</em>. You can download a variety of plugins and themes to customize your look and efficiency of your Terminal. Please follow the guidelines <a href="https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh">here</a> on how to set up and install Oh My ZSH.</p>
<p>You can also use the complete <a href="https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki">Oh My ZSH Wiki</a> on how to customize and configure your Terminal further.</p>
<p>In some cases, you would see mentions and suggestions to download and use third-party CLIs such as <code>iTerm</code> (or <code>cygwin</code> for Windows PC users) instead of the default Terminal installed in your system. On the list of themes in Oh My ZSH, some of them will require these third-party CLIs in order to make these themes work. For the sake of this course, we will stick to the default Terminal. Please be sure to choose a theme on the list that is compatible with all CLIs.</p>
