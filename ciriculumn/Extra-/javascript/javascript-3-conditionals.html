<h3 id="motivation">Motivation</h3>
<p>JavaScript is used on the frontend of almost every website. It’s also a widely-used scripting language that be used on the backend as well. The JavaScript lessons set a solid foundation in JavaScript basics so we can use the language in more robust ways in later lessons.</p>

<h3 id="things-to-remember">Things to Remember</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Booleans are not strings.</strong> Booleans (<code>true</code> and <code>false</code>) are their own data type. If you wrap quotes around a Boolean (<code>"true"</code> and <code>"false"</code>), it is no longer a Boolean, it is a string.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>In JS, almost always use <code>===</code> when assessing equality.</strong> Using <code>==</code> will sometimes cause problems because JS can force a data type to be changed.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Pseudocode is incredibly helpful for organizing your thoughts and planning what code you will write.</strong> Use it freely!</p></li>

<h3 id="independent-practice">Independent Practice</h3>
<p>Techtonica staff will assign pairs.</p>
<p><strong>Activity: Movie Night</strong> Suppose 5 classmates are interested in going to see a movie together. There are some interesting dynamics between the people in this group, as described below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Priya will attend only if Ming goes.</li>
<li>David loves popcorn and will go to the movies under any circumstance</li>
<li>Alex will automatically go to the movies if David goes, and will automatically not go to the movies if David does not go</li>
<li>Ming will not attend if David has already said he is attending and Ming will say yes if Priya says yes.</li>
<li>Breanna loves to be around people and will only go if there are at least 2 others going</li>
</ul>
<p>Write a function called <code>movieNight</code> that takes in an array. The array must contain 3 strings, and each string must be one of the names shown above who are interested in going to the movies. And the array should include all the combinaton of three names out of five(total 10 possible array input). Write a body for the <code>movieNight</code> function, based on the “rules” associated with each of the names above, that returns an array of the people who will attend the movie. Your function should account for the logic necessary for all 5 people, so that no matter which names are given, the result will always be correct. (ie: Don’t just code the logic for 3 of the names and pass those names in all the time.) In case there are multiple answer for a single triplet or input string display all the possible correct answer for that triplet.</p>
<p><strong>Result for different combination of input array</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Consider the starting alphabet of each name represents the name:
<ul>
<li>(INPUT) (OUTPUT)</li>
<li>[‘P’, ‘D’, ‘A’] = [‘D’, ‘A’, ‘B’]</li>
<li>[‘P’, ‘D’, ‘M’] = [‘D’, ‘A’, ‘B’]</li>
<li>[‘P’, ‘B’, ‘A’] = [‘P’, ‘M’, ‘B’]</li>
<li>[‘P’, ‘B’, ‘M’] = [‘P’, ‘M’, ‘B’]</li>
<li>[‘B’, ‘A’, ‘M’] = [‘P’, ‘M’, ‘B’]</li>
<li>[‘D’, ‘B’, ‘A’] = [‘D’, ‘A’, ‘B’]</li>
<li>[‘D’, ‘A’, ‘M’] = [‘D’, ‘A’, ‘B’]</li>
<li>[‘A’, ‘M’, ‘P’] = [‘P’, ‘M’, ‘B’]</li>
<li>[‘D’, ‘B’, ‘M’] = [‘D’, ‘A’, ‘B’]</li>
<li>[‘P’, ‘D’, ‘B’] = [‘D’, ‘A’, ‘B’]</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example</strong> For example, <code>movieNight(['Priya', 'David', 'Breanna'])</code> should return <code>['David', 'Alex', 'Breanna']</code> because:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Alex gets added automatically because David is going</li>
<li>Priya doesn’t go because Ming is not going.</li>
<li>Breanna will go because there are at least 2 others going</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Things to Consider</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>What information about each person will you need to turn into code? What “tools” do you have in JavaScript that can help you code that logic?</li>
<li>What information do you need to store throughout your program? How will you store it? Does this information need to be updated at some point during the program, or will it remain fixed?</li>
<li>This is a tricky challenge because there is a lot of logic in it, and some people’s logic is tied to other people’s logic. But, this challenge is not designed to trick you or to be impossibly hard. Break it down into very small pieces, and then fit those small pieces together.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="group-practice">Group Practice</h3>
<p>Techtonica staff will assign new pairs. With your new pair, share your code with one another. It’s OK if you didn’t finish! Your new pair might be able to give you some suggestions, or you might get some ideas from their code. Discuss what you found challenging about this activity.</p>
<h3 id="challenge">Challenge</h3>
<ul>
<li>Solve this challenge on HackerRank: <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/js10-if-else">Conditional Statements: If-Else</a></li>
<li>Solve the Boolean Logic Exercises Quiz on Rithm School (https://www.rithmschool.com/courses/javascript/introduction-to-javascript-boolean-exercises)</li>
<li>Create your own coding challenge similar to this one, but change the setting (going to a restaurant or the beach?) and the logic for each person. In fact, you can use almost the exact same wording. See if you can code the solution on your own. Or, find another pair that has also written their own version of this coding challenge, swap challenges, and see if you can solve theirs!</li>
