<ul>
<li>Recruiters are expecting this conversation, and you have almost nothing to lose if you are reasonable and polite. In the VERY UNLIKELY case that they do rescind the offer, this is a very big RED FLAG for that company, and you are probably better off not working there.</li>

<p><strong>Role Playing</strong></p>

<li>Split into pairs. What month were you born? The partner born later in the year will be the employer, and the partner born in the earlier month will be the interviewee. Using the info on the “Role Playing” slide, and practice your negotiating skills.</li>
<li>After 5 minutes, find another pair, and have the interviewees swap places. Now that you have a new partner, switch roles so everyone has a chance to be the employer for 5 min and the interviewee for 5 min.</li>
