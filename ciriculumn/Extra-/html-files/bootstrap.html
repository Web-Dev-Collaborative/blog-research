<h3 id="things-to-remember">Things to Remember</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bootstrap is currently on version 4</strong></li>
<li><strong>There is no need to download the Bootstrap files.</strong> Simply use a CDN link as shown in the slides and the Bootstrap docs.</li>
<li><strong>There is a</strong> <code>bootstrap.css</code> <strong>and a</strong> <code>bootstrap.js</code> <strong>.</strong> The <code>bootstrap.css</code> file is what most people refer to when they talk about Bootstrap. The <code>bootstrap.js</code> file is only necessary when you want to make interactive components like drop-down menus, modals, and the like. In that case, you’ll need to use <code>bootstrap.js</code> <strong>in addition to</strong> <code>bootstrap.css</code>.</li>
<li><strong>The</strong> <code>bootstrap.js</code> <strong>file needs jQuery in order to work.</strong> Make sure you’ve linked to the jQuery CDN <strong>above</strong> your link to the <code>bootstrap.js</code> CDN.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="independent-practice">Independent Practice</h3>
<p><strong>Activity 1 - What Can Be Done with Bootstrap?</strong></p>
<p>This is an independent activity and pairs will not be assigned.</p>
<p>Spend 20 minutes exploring this link given in the “Supplemental Materials” section above: <a href="https://bootstrapdocs.com/v3.3.5/docs/components/">Things you can build using Bootstrap</a>. Make a list that includes some of the most useful components, your favorite components, or components you think would be really neat to add to a project.</p>
<p>Spend 10 minutes exploring this link given in the “Supplemental Materials” section above: <a href="https://bootstrapdocs.com/v3.3.5/docs/javascript/">Interactive Bootstrap features</a>. Add some of these features to the list you created in the first portion.</p>
<p><strong>Activity 2 - Your First Bootstrap Webpage!</strong></p>
<p>Techtonica staff will assign pairs.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Using your Terminal, navigate to your Desktop.</p></li>
<li><p>Create a new directory called <code>vegetables-webpage</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Navigate to <code>vegetables-webpage</code>. Open the whole directory with <code>code .</code> .</p></li>
<li><p>Create a file called <code>vegetables.html</code>. It should automatically appear in the left sidebar in VS Code as an editable file.</p></li>
<li><p>Open <a href="https://www.teaching-materials.org/bootstrap-hosting-github/exercises/grid/grid_instructions">this lab exercise</a> in a new tab by pressing <code>&lt;CONTROL&gt;</code> and clicking on the link. A selection box will appear. Click on “Open in new tab”.</p></li>
<li><p>Open the link provided in the first bullet point in a new tab as well. Using the Quick Source Viewer Chrome extension you installed in the “Chrome Developer Tools” lesson, view the HTML and talk through the code with your pair partner. Can you explain what each section accomplishes? Once you feel satisfied that you understand what the code is doing, move on to the next step.</p></li>
<li><p>Copy the HTML you accessed in the previous step into <code>vegetables.html</code>. Save the file. Close the Chrome tab that you opened in Step 6 (the one you used the Chrome Quick Source Viewer extension on).</p></li>
<li><p>In a new tab, open <code>vegetables.html</code> in Chrome using one of the techniques you learned in the “HTML” lesson. It should look the same as the example you saw a moment ago. You’ll refer back to this tab through this exercise as you add code and refresh this webpage.</p></li>
<li><p>Continue on with the tutorial you opened in Step 5 and see how far you can get. You’ll likely make small bursts of progress using trial and error. That’s OK! Be patient with yourself. Remember to stick to the 20-minute rule before asking a peer or instructor for help. Before clicking “Show Solution” at the bottom of the tutorial, please give this exercise a good-faith effort.</p></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="challenge">Challenge</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Did you specify in <code>vegetables.html</code> column widths for various screen sizes? If you didn’t, please do so now.</p></li>
<li><p>Using online resources, add a Bootstrap modal window component to your Vegetables webpage. The modal window should display some content, and also open and close. Remember: which Bootstrap CDN link do you need to add before you can add interactive features?</p></li>
</ol>
