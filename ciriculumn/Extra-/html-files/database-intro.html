<p>This week you’ll learn all about about databases. Databases are super important because they store the data for your application! For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>For an online store, a database stores the items available, prices, and past orders.</li>
<li>For a social media site, a database stores the user profiles, posts, and follows/friendships between users.</li>
</ul>
<p>Databases let data persist in your application across multiple users and sessions.</p>
