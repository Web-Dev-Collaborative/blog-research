<p>These instructions apply to anything that you need to submit to the SEAM for review. If unsure if you need to submit something, ask the SEAM.</p>
<h2 id="push-to-your-assignments-repository">Push to Your Assignments Repository</h2>
<ul>
<li>Create a branch, e.g. <code>game-project</code> on your checked out copy of your assignments repo
<ul>
<li>If using a separate repository from your assignments repo, see FAQ below</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Commit your work locally using git on the branch (don’t use <code>main</code>)</li>
<li>Push these commits to your homework repository, usually something like: https://github.com/YOUR-NAME/techtonica-assignments</li>
<li>The SEAM will send each of you a link to their <em>fork</em> of that repo, something like https://github.com/SEAM/techtonica-assignments-YOUR-NAME
<ul>
<li>If you forget you can always find it at the top right <strong>Fork</strong> button which lists all known forks of your repo</li>
</ul></li>
<li>When viewing that repo you should see an indicator of commits differing between the two</li>
<li>After opening the pull request you can checkout main and start a new branch for your next assignment</li>
<li>Do not merge your pull request commits into main until they have be reviewed and merged to the SEAM fork (usually 7-10 days later)</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="./pr-example-1.png" /></p>
<p>These are your commits since last merged PR.</p>
<p>When you click “New Pull Request” you’ll see this page.</p>
<p><img src="./pr-example-2.png" /></p>
<p>There will be a small hint about which “base” to use.</p>
<p><img src="./pr-example-3.png" /></p>
<p>Verify the changes are what you’d like to have reviewed. If it is too many changes you’ll need to create a branch with <em>only</em> the changes you want to be reviewed. When in doubt, smaller PR’s are easier to review and merge.</p>
<h3 id="naming">Naming</h3>
<p>The default name of the PR is the last commit message. Instead, please make it the name of the assignment used, e.g.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>HTML/JS Game Project - Boggle</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="general-suggestions">General Suggestions</h3>
<ul>
<li>Read any PR comments and try to address the feedback promptly. It’s harder to remember the code if more time has elapsed.</li>
<li>If the feedback is confusing, ask for clarification or for your pair to read it and see if they understand</li>
<li>Keep the SEAM’s fork up to date so you’re not opening a huge PR or multiple PR’s in one week</li>
<li>Volunteers may review the PR’s and so they may not know as much context. Try to be understanding if they misinterpet what we’re doing</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>That’s entirely up to you</li>
<li>For the purposes of submitting for review, the SEAM will only review PR’s in their fork of your Assignments repo</li>
<li>Get your separate repo is in a state where you want to review</li>
<li>Copy the folder of your repo (using regular <code>cp</code>) to your assignments repo. For simplicity, naming the destination folder as the same of your repo might help keep things simple
<ul>
<li>consider adding <code>-snapshot</code> to the end of the name to help remind you it’s just a copy of another repo and won’t stay in sync</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Commit and push those changes to your assignments repo</li>
<li>Open a PR to the SEAM’s fork as above</li>
</ul>
