<h3 id="lesson">Lesson</h3>
<p>Having difficult conversations in the workplace can be emotionally charged making it difficult to communicate well.</p>
<p>Try to think of a time when you have had a difficult conversation in the past, either at work or in your personal life. List in your head the emotions that you associate with that moment. Now think about how that conversation could have been better if you were able to take the emotion out of it. It is easier to convey and recieve messages when you are calm and confident.</p>
<p>Additionally, when there is conflict we often make assumptions about why it is happening and the intentions of the others involved. Learning to take a step back and prepare for these times is essential to your success in the workplace.</p>
<p>Some situations that might require you to have difficult conversations at work include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Being passed up for a new role in the organization</li>
<li>Finding it a struggle to collaborate with your team. Personalities can play a big part in the success or lack of success of a team.</li>
<li>Feeling like the work environment is hostile or inequitable; or having colleagues who talk and/or joke inappropriately.</li>
<li>Needing help with a mistake that you have made.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="common-mistakes-misconceptions">Common Mistakes / Misconceptions</h3>
<p>Sometimes avoiding the difficult conversation seems like the best route.</p>
<ul>
<li>We think we can ignore the inappropriate banter of colleagues.</li>
<li>We make excuses in our head for why someone else got the new position that we wanted.</li>
<li>It feels easier to ignore the conflicts with others on our team.</li>
</ul>
<p>WRONG! These problems will continue to cause challenges if you avoid having the difficult conversation.</p>
<h3 id="guided-practice">Guided Practice</h3>
<p>On slide 6 look at the scenarios being described and fill in the ‘I should say…’ box.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>I should have been put on that project. That person is completely incompetent. I should say: I have experience with the work on that project. It surprised me that I wasn’t assigned to that task.</li>
<li>You are not doing your work for this project on purpose because you dislike me. I should say: The due date for this part of the project is approaching. What needs to happen to get it done?</li>
<li>You think that this project is impossible and it can’t succeed. You just want me to fail. I should say: I feel as if this project is bigger than I originally realized. I need support from my team to complete it successfully.</li>
<li>You need to start working harder. You are lazy and I am going to fire you if you don’t start producing I should say: I would like to have our rate of completion for projects milestones improve. Can you share with me what you can do to meet deadlines more regularly?</li>
</ol>
