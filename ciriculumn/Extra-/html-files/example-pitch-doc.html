<p><em>Short, 1-3 sentences about the project and why it matters to you.</em></p>
<p>Casual Care Pool is a way for neighbors to find pet owners in their neighborhood to swap pet care with. I’m building it because I have a hard time finding good swaps for my two unruly pomeranians.</p>
<h2 id="technology">Technology</h2>
<p><em>What tools/framework will you use</em></p>
<ul>
<li>CCP will be a mobile app so you can use it on the go and “friend” someone with their QR code if you meet IRL</li>
<li>I will use React Native to build the UI</li>
<li>the backend API will be PEN Postgres/Express/Node</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="mvp-minimum-viable-product">MVP (Minimum Viable Product)</h2>
<ul>
<li>User registration (you and your pet(s))</li>
<li>Finding a pet owner in the DB</li>
<li>Requesting a dog meet &amp; greet</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="additional-nice-to-have-features">Additional Nice-to-Have Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>Show nearby pets on a map (Google Maps API??)</li>
<li>QR code friending</li>
<li>Scheduling care, integrating with Google Calendar</li>
<li>Karma points to encourage helping others</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="technical-risks">Technical Risks</h2>
<p><em>What might go wrong? (and how you’ll adjust your plan if they do) - <strong>Minimum 2</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li>React Native might be too complicated
<ul>
<li>In that case I will just build a response web app with regular React</li>
</ul></li>
<li>I run out of time on the owner &amp; pet registration UI
<ul>
<li>I will simplify and just have the dog register but with human contact info (only one table, limit to single dog)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
