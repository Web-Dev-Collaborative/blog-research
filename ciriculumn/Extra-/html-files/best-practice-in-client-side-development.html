<li><a href="https://www.blindtextgenerator.com/about-lorem-ipsum">About dummy text Lorem ipsum (10 min)</a> - Lorem Ipsum refers to text that developer/designer use as replacement text when the real text is not available. The purpose of Lorem Ipsum is to create a natural looking block of text (sentence, paragraph, page, etc.) that doesnâ€™t distract from the layout. Similar there is Lorem Picsum which refers to images that developer/designer use as filler images when the real images are not available.</li>
<li>A developer uses Lorem Ipsum/Picsum in their project, when the developer creates an initial version of his project then he uses Lorem Ipsum as a placeholder for that.</li>
<li>When designer designs something then he uses Lorem Ipsum/Picsum in mockup design to choose font-family and font colors for the real text in the final design.
