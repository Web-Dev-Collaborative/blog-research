<p>Demonstrate understanding of React, Enzyme, Jest, MongoDB, Mongoose, and Auth0 by creating a simple sign-up app.</p>
<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>In this project, you will build a log-in page and a sign-up page for a fictional kickball tournament happening whatever date you like, using the technologies listed above.</p>
<h3 id="basic-requirements">Basic Requirements</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>You can do online research, but do not share knowledge with other apprentices today.</li>

<h2 id="setup-instructions">Setup Instructions</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Since you already installed create-react-app during the React topic, navigate to your projects folder on the command line and enter: <code>create-react-app kickball-signup</code></p></li>
<li><p>Initialize a git repo in your new kickball-signup folder and track it using git. You will be turning your repo in at the end of the day.</p></li>

<hr />
<h4 id="part-1---react">Part 1 - React</h4>
<ul>
<li>[ ] You must route the app so it has 2 pages - an initial page with a sign-in button, and a kickball sign-ups page. After clicking the log-in button, you user should be taken to the Kickball sign-ups page.</li>
<li>[ ] Create a form with 1 input. It should be labelled ‘Enter your name’ or something similar. Make sure the input value is reflected in the state.</li>
<li>[ ] There should be a submit button labeled something like “sign me up!”. Design it so that when the submit button is clicked, it calls a function that makes an ajax or fetch request to your server.</li>
<li>[ ] After submitting, a list under the form should contain the new name.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h4 id="part-2---mongodb">Part 2 - MongoDB</h4>
<ul>
<li>[ ] Create a new mongoDB environment and user on mLab, and create a document to start with a few dummy names on your sign-up list.</li>
<li>[ ] Install a Nodejs/ExpressJS backend.</li>
<li>[ ] Create working get and post methods for your app using Mongoose.</li>
<li>[ ] Remember to save all your mLab and Auth0 secrets in an .env file.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h4 id="part-3---auth0">Part 3 - Auth0</h4>
<ul>
<li>[ ] Add Auth0 authentication</li>
<li>[ ] have the sign-in button on your initial landing page redirect the user to the Auth0 log-in.</li>
<li>[ ] Show the sign-in page when the user is not logged in; otherwise show the kickball sign-ups form page.</li>
<li>[ ] Create a sign-out button on the Kickball signups page that erases the auth token from the client’s local storage.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h4 id="part-4---enzyme">Part 4 - Enzyme</h4>
<ul>
<li>[ ] Add shallow and mount testing with Enzyme and Jest to all of your React components.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h4 id="part-4---submit-your-project">Part 4 - Submit your project</h4>
<ul>
<li>[ ] Send the url of your GitHub repo to your Program Manager. You will learn how to deploy your finished app on Monday.</li>
