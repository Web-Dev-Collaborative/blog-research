<p><strong>What is TwilioQuest?</strong></p>
<p>TwilioQuest is an interactive tutorial where users can learn how to use Twilio to create automated text messages &amp; responses.</p>
<p><strong>What will I learn/what will I work on?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Objective:</strong> Get a Twilio Phone Number - Setup a Twilio phone number that can handle both voice/text. *Note: TwilioQuest uses the verbiage “buy” but you do not actually have to pay for anything as long as you don’t enter a billing address.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Objective:</strong> Explore the Twilio API Explorer - Learn how to use the API explorer for Twilio APIs. In this objective, you’ll send a text message to your phone from the Twilio Console. - <strong>Exercise:</strong> Create a POST request using JSON and look at the Response.</p></li>
<li><p>Example: <img src="./Screen%20Shot%202018-10-08%20at%207.15.15%20PM.png" alt="alt text" /></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Objective:</strong> Create a TWIML Bin - TwiML is the key to working with voice calls and responding to SMS messages. Host some TwiML with Twilio without having to set up a server. - <strong>Exercise:</strong> Create a TwiML Bin that greets a voice caller. Configure your Twilio voice phone number to answer voice calls with that TwiML Bin. Dial your Twilio number to confirm it answers the call and plays your greeting.</p></li>
<li><p>Example: <img src="./Screen%20Shot%202018-10-08%20at%207.26.01%20PM.png" alt="alt text" /></p></li>
<li><strong>Objective:</strong> Twilio Functions - When a TwiML Bin won’t do, you can write your own Node.js code using Twilio Functions. - <strong>Exercise:</strong> Generate TwiML with Twilio Functions to respond to SMS messages with a random fact about dogs. Configure a Twilio phone number to respond to SMS messages with that Twilio Function. Send a text message to your Twilio number to confirm it responds with a dog fact.</li>
<li><p>Example: <img src="./Screen%20Shot%202018-10-08%20at%207.31.03%20PM.png" alt="alt text" /></p></li>
<li><strong>Objective:</strong> Set up NGROK for local development. *Note: This step is necessary if you plan to develop locally. When the time comes to test that server code you’ve written, you need a way to publicly access it without the hassle of deploying to a public host. This is where ngrok can help us. - <strong>Exercise:</strong> Serve up a static web page that displays the text “Hello World” - accessible from the public internet. Verify the page can be reached via your ngrok url (either in a new browser tab, or your mobile browser of choice).</li>
<li><p>Example: <img src="./Screen%20Shot%202018-10-08%20at%207.44.02%20PM.png" alt="alt text" /> <img src="./Screen%20Shot%202018-10-08%20at%207.44.12%20PM.png" alt="alt text" /> <img src="./Screen%20Shot%202018-10-08%20at%207.44.22%20PM.png" alt="alt text" /></p></li>
