<p><a href="https://github.com/Techtonica/curriculum/tree/main/projects/data-structures-algorithms-assessment.md">Assessment Outline: Data Structures</a></p>
<p>These are all in <strong>weighted order</strong>, so most important topics are first.</p>
<h2 id="stacks-queues-linked-lists">Stacks / Queues / Linked-Lists</h2>
<ul>
<li>Linked-Lists
<ul>
<li>Big O performance of operations</li>
<li>Key difference between a linked-list and an array</li>
<li>Implement a linked-list from scratch in JS</li>
<li>Learn and tech linked-lists first because they are used by the other data structures</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Understand when to use a queue vs stack</li>
<li>Be familiar with common interface methods (push, pop, peek)</li>
<li>How is a stack used by your computer when running your own code (call stack)
<ul>
<li>Why can you get stack overflow?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Implement a queue
<ul>
<li>using an Array as the underlying storage</li>
<li>using a Linked-List as the underlying storage</li>
<li>pros/cons for choosing Array vs Linked-List</li>
</ul></li>
<li>What is a priority queue? (Priority Queues are very popular interview questions)</li>
<li><em>Note: deque aka double-ended queue is not important to learn</em></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="hash-table">Hash Table</h2>
<ul>
<li>Why are Hash Tables useful?
<ul>
<li>The basic interface methods (get, set)</li>
<li>Know the Big O of hash table operations</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Be able to solve problems that uses JavaScript <code>Map</code> and <code>Set</code> to solve problems
<ul>
<li>Why use a Map vs Set?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Basic idea behind a hashing function
<ul>
<li>What characteristics make an effective hashing function?</li>
<li>You don’t necessarily need to be able to implement one yourself as doing it well is difficult</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="trees">Trees</h2>
<ul>
<li>Binary trees are the most important type of tree
<ul>
<li>Searching a binary tree is one of the most core recursive algorithms used</li>
<li>If you understand binary search, most other operations will make sense</li>
<li>How to implement core methods (add, find) given Node and Tree class skeleton code</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Tries
<ul>
<li>A very useful type of tree, typically with 26 branches (a-z) at each node instead of 2</li>
<li>How tries store their information (different than most other trees)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Examples of tree structures in the wild: DOM, Filesystem</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="array-sortingsearching">Array Sorting/Searching</h2>
<ul>
<li>Binary search of a sorted array is one of the most fundemental algorithms
<ul>
<li>you should understand its pseudocode and be able to implement from scratch in JS</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Other Searching algorithms
<ul>
<li>Linear search: its Big O and how to implement it</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Simple sorting algorithms
<ul>
<li>Bubble</li>
<li>Selection</li>
<li>Know how to implement them</li>
<li>Know their Big O</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Fast Sorting Algorithms and their peformance
<ul>
<li>Merge</li>
<li>Know its Big O</li>
<li>Understand its pseudocode</li>
<li>You don’t need to know how to implement from scratch</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
