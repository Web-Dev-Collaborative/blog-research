<li><a href="https://google.com">Other example article(20 min read)</a> - Answer the 3 questions at the end. (Be sure to explain how to use these materials in directions in one of the sections below (ie: lesson, guided practice). If you are not assigning them somehow, they should be placed under Supplemental Materials at the bottom.)</li>

<h3 id="lesson">Lesson</h3>
<p>Here’s text about introducing something and how it works.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://google.com">Be sure to link the slideshow, video,</a></li>
<li><a href="https://google.com">or other materials you expect them to follow as part of the lesson.</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Build on the first information. Have apprentices guess things, do an activity, etc.</p>
<p>Make sure to mention these things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Things - This is a sub-thing</li>
<li>More things</li>
<li>Even more things</li>
<li>Even more things</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="common-mistakes-misconceptions">Common Mistakes &amp; Misconceptions</h3>
<p>List things that apprentices might not realize, might assume at first, or should avoid.</p>
<ul>
<li>Example</li>
<li>Example</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="guided-practice">Guided Practice</h3>
<p>Have the apprentices work with you as you do something step-by-step. This can also be fulfilled by a detailed tutorial intended for beginners.</p>
<h3 id="independent-practice">Independent Practice</h3>
<p>Class does this thing themselves with specific additional items. This could be alone, with a partner, or small group; but the idea is that it’s less guided, more independent.</p>
<h3 id="challenge">Challenge</h3>
<p>Apprentices can try to do this other thing. Ideally, they will be challenged to connect what they’ve learned to some previous knowledge or additional research.</p>
<h3 id="check-for-understanding">Check for Understanding</h3>
<p>Some ideas: have apprentices summarize to each other, make a cheat sheet, take a quiz, do an assignment, or something else that helps them self-assess their understanding. This exercise should help apprentices determine whether they’ve met the outline objectives, or if they need to review.ss</p>
