<h3 id="primary-goals">Primary Goals</h3>
<p>To build UI and client-side tests for a portfolio-ready client-side application.</p>
<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>You’ll build a Restaurant Recommender app that will help you practice building a complete client-side Object Oriented application. This will take 2-3 days, and is due to the Program Facilitor by noon on Friday.</p>
<h3 id="context">Context</h3>
<p>Now that you’ve finished Part 1 and your Restaurant Recommender class is complete, you will create a UI that allows a user to implement your class methods in a tested, deployed website.</p>
<h3 id="user-requirements">User Requirements</h3>

<h4 id="tips">Tips:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Although your wireframe will not be assessed, we highly recommend looking at websites that have successful UIs for creating, retrieving, updating, deleting, and filtering data, and wireframe your design before starting to code with jQuery, HTML, or CSS. Consider designing a desktop and a mobile version to make coding as straight-forward as possible. It will be much easier overall!</li>
<li>If you ‘finish early’, use your extra time to get user feedback and refine your app as much as you can.</li>
</ul>
