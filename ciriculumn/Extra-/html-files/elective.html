<p><em>Template Intro</em></p>
<p><strong>Elective Template</strong></p>
<p>Elective resources are content that is not part of the core in-person curriculum roadmap, but that is a valuable framework, tool, or technique to learn as a web application engineer.</p>
<p>It is shorter than a normal <a href="./topic-outline.md">topic outline</a> and typically uses more external resources.</p>
<p>Copy this file as a starting point and create your new file in the <code>/electives</code> folder. Your elective should include the following sections:</p>
<h1 id="section"><TECHNOLOGY NAME></h1>
<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>Write one short paragraph or bulleted list than answers the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why is it worth spending extra time to learn this technology?</li>
<li>How do it compare do similar material covered in the main curriculum. See the root <a href="/README.md">README</a> for topics already covered</li>
<li>What problem does it solve?</li>
<li>Why would you recommend it?</li>
<li>Do not go into implementation details, as you can link to docs that do that later</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>What is the technology? Instead of using the project’s own description, how would you describe it to a junior engineer?</p>
<h2 id="how-to-get-started">How to Get Started</h2>
<p>Link to a free hands-on tutorial on getting started with the app. <a href="https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html">Example for React</a> from their official docs.</p>
<p>Please only include one tutorial here, one you gave gone through yourself and vetted for quality. If you have a few you like, choose the best one for a beginner audience. Any runner-ups can go in the “Further Reading” section below.</p>
<h2 id="further-reading">Further Reading</h2>
<ul>
<li>For a library/tool always include links to the official docs and</li>
<li>link its GitHub page</li>
<li>The next best thing to read after the above content</li>
<li>A list of important links to blogs and docs about the tech</li>
</ul>
