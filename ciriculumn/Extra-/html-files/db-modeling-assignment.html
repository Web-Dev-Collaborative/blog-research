<h1 id="assignment-data-modeling">Assignment: Data Modeling</h1>
<p>Now that you’ve learned about relational databases and SQL, let’s put together what we’ve learned and create a database.</p>
<h2 id="submission-process">Submission Process</h2>
<ul>
<li>Once you are finished, or the due date has arrived, please export your entire database as a SQL file and include a copy of this file with your example queries.</li>
<li>You can use CLI <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/backup-dump.html">psql</a> or a <a href="https://www.pgadmin.org/">GUI app like pgadmin</a> to export the file</li>
<li>Add them to a new folder in your assignments repo</li>
<li>Make a pull request</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="app-domain">App Domain</h2>
<p>The domain is similar to Instagram. You might want to read through the queries first to decide how best to store the data.</p>
<h2 id="tables-data">Tables &amp; Data</h2>
<ul>
<li>Each <strong>User</strong> has a username
<ul>
<li>since this username can change so you should also include a primary key that will not change (its format is up to you)</li>
<li>also store their email so we can send them messages</li>
<li>the date they joined is stored so we can show how long they’ve been a member</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Users can upload zero to many <strong>Photos</strong>
<ul>
<li>Store the URL of a photo already on the internet (we will not store the photos themselves)</li>
<li>Store the date the photo was added</li>
<li>Each photo should belong to one and only one user</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Users can Heart a photo
<ul>
<li>Store the time this like occurred</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Users can Un-Heart a photo</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="queries">Queries</h2>
<p>After designing and creating your tables above, include SQL for the following queries</p>
<h3 id="creatingupdating-data">Creating/Updating Data</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>Insert a new user that is joining the platform</li>
<li>Insert record that a user uploaded a photo of a given url</li>
<li>Update the database to record that a user Heart’ed a specific photo</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="reading-data">Reading Data</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>Select all columns from the photo table that were uploaded by one user (given their primary key)</li>
<li>Select the image URLs of all Photos that a specific User ID Hearted</li>
<li>Select all the usernames who Hearted a given photo (given the photo’s primary key)</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="end-of-requirements">End of Requirements</h2>
<p>If you have completed the above, or the due date has arrived, please submit according to instructions above. If you want more challenges, please continue.</p>
<h2 id="bonus-queries">Bonus Queries</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>Find the user with the most Hearts across all their photos</li>
<li>Find the single most recently added photo of one user (given their username)</li>
<li>Find the photo with the most Hearts</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="bonus">Bonus</h2>
<ul>
<li>Make the database enforce that the usernames:
<ul>
<li>are unique</li>
<li>can be used in a url easily (no spaces, no URL characters - e.g. it can’t contain a ‘?’ or ‘/’ since those having meaning in a URL)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Create a way to store which users follow each other (hint: following is unidirectional)</li>
</ul>
