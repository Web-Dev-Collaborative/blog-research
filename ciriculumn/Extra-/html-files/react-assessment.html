<h4 id="react-enzyme">React &amp; Enzyme</h4>
<ul>
<li>[ ] Plan out the user’s journey:
<ul>
<li>where will they find the event attendee feature? where would they look for it?</li>
<li>how will the data be organized?</li>
<li>will the user need do perform an action to make the data visible?</li>
<li>will the data stay on the page, or can it be closed/minimized?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>[ ] Present and style your new data somewhere in the UI using React. Functionality should take priority over beauty.</li>
<li>[ ] Add shallow and mount testing with Enzyme and Jest for your new elements. ** Use any extra time to improve test coverage and add polish. You will be deploying this project next week. ** Commit early and often, with useful commit messages.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="submit-your-project">Submit your project</h4>
<ul>
<li>[ ] Your project and new feature must run.</li>
<li>[ ] Note any updates to run instructions in your branch’s README.md.</li>
<li>[ ] Do not merge “attendees” to your main branch. Push up your final changes, and send the url of your updated project to your Program Manager.</li>
