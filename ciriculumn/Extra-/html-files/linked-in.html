<h3 id="common-mistakes-misconceptions">Common Mistakes &amp; Misconceptions</h3>
<p>List things that apprentices might not realize, might assume at first, or should avoid.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>LinkedIn Profile is a story of who you are becoming not everything you have been. It does not need to be a history of every job you have ever had. If you worked in retail for 7 years and now want a job as a software engineer then there is no need to include the retail experience in your LinkedIn profile. If you do then it will hurt you in search results done by a recruiter. For example a recruiter will do a search for “Software Engineer” “1-3 years” experience and you will not appear although you may have 1 year of experience. You will appear in the search for “Software Engineer” “8-10 years” because LinkedIn counts years of work experience not specific to your title.</p></li>
<li><p>LinkedIn is Not Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter. Only post and comment on things that represent you as an employee. Keep a strict line bewteen professional and personal. For example I can post on LinkedIn that I am going to a Women in Tech dinner or maybe reading a book about bias in the workplace. If I am going to a political march on human rights then unless I am doing that as a organized sponsored company event I keep that to my Facebook page.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="guided-practice-1">Guided Practice</h3>
<p>Have the apprentices work with you as you do something step-by-step. This can also be fulfilled by a detailed tutorial intended for beginners.</p>
<h3 id="independent-practice">Independent Practice</h3>
<p>Class does this thing themselves with specific additional items. This could be alone, with a partner, or small group; but the idea is that it’s less guided, more independent.</p>
<h3 id="challenge">Challenge</h3>
<p>Apprentices can try to do this other thing. Ideally, they will be challenged to connect what they’ve learned to some previous knowledge or additional research.</p>
<h3 id="check-for-understanding">Check for Understanding</h3>
<p>Review 10 profiles of people with similar expereince level and think how they could improve their profile and see if that applies to you too.</p>
