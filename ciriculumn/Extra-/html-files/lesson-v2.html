<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>
<p>Here are topics that should be understood before this topic. <strong>Try to minimize these and even if the reader has learned a topic, don’t assume they are an expert.</strong> Briefly reminding them of concepts is helpful for learning.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../git/git-version-control.md">Git version control</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="motivation">Motivation</h3>
<p>Why it is worth learning this topic</p>
<ul>
<li>Include links to future lessons/work this will help with - this will plant the seed later</li>
<li>How does fit this tool fit into the ecosystem? (if applicable)</li>
<li>If a fellow engineer asked about this tool/technique, what would your succinct answer be?</li>
<li>If it’s especially helpful for interviews, that’s good motivation</li>
<li>Try to use rationale that won’t change. “X is popular” or “Big Company Y uses Framework Z” are likely to be stale quickly.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="objectives">Objectives</h3>
<p>The important areas you should leave this lesson knowing.</p>
<p><a href="#section"></a> How to do X <a href="#section"></a> Difference between A and B <a href="#section"></a> Be able to build Y</p>
<h3 id="lesson">Lesson</h3>
<p>A high-level, skimmable introduction to the topic.</p>
<p>It can contain links to external materials but you should summarize here in your own words.</p>
<h3 id="section"></h3>
<h3 id="common-mistakes-misconceptions">Common Mistakes &amp; Misconceptions</h3>
<p>This section is optional, but if there are common misunderstandings, please enumerate them here. List things that apprentices might not realize, might assume at first, or should avoid.</p>
<ul>
<li>i.e. Array.splice and Array.slice are totally different</li>
<li><code>for (let x of obj)</code> loops and <code>for (let elem in obj)</code> loops are different</li>
<li><code>const</code> variables are not immutable; they just can’t be reassigned</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="guided-practice">Guided Practice</h3>
<p>Have the apprentices work with you as you do something step-by-step. This should be inlined here as original content, not just linked to an external tutorials.</p>
<h3 id="independent-practice">Independent Practice</h3>
<p>Class does this thing themselves with specific additional items. This could be alone, with a partner, or small group; but the idea is that it’s less guided, more independent.</p>
<h3 id="challenge">Challenge</h3>
<p>Building on the independent practice, here are some challenging optional add-ons the reader can do.</p>
<h3 id="supplemental-materials">Supplemental Materials</h3>
<p>Here you can link in external tutorials, official or unofficial documentation pages, blogs, videos, etc. - <a href="https://google.com">example website</a> - short description (approximate duration to watch/read) - <a href="https://google.com">Other example website</a> - description</p>
