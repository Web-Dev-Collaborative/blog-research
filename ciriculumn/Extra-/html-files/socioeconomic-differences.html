<p>A person’s socioeconomic status can inform their identity, as it affects the community around them and their lived experiences. Therefore, there are some shared experiences among people who come from blue-collar backgrounds and move to white-collar jobs. The experience can be unsettling, and feel alienating at times, as it might be hard to understand a different workplace environment, and experience potentially negative responses from people around them. The purpose of covering this topic is to help people recognize what might cause those feelings, and be able to address them when they arise.</p>
