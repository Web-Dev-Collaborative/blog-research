<p>In this project you will create a well-designed webpage that displays one of your favorite recipes. It will include the ingredients, the steps needed to make the dish, links to similar recipes, and at least one photo.</p>
<p>Phase 1 of the project involves coding the structure of your webpage using HTML. This includes the ingredients, the steps needed to make the dish, links to similar recipes, and at least one photo.</p>
<p>Phase 2 of the project involves adding styling and pizazz using CSS. This includes changing the font style, font size, colors, and significantly altering the layout.</p>
<p>Phase 3 of the project involves incorporating Bootstrap. You’ll add a navigation bar and several other Bootstrap components of your choosing.</p>

<h3 id="lab-exercise">Lab Exercise</h3>
<h4 id="part-1---properly-link-to-the-bootstrap-css-cdn">Part 1 - Properly link to the Bootstrap CSS CDN</h4>
<p>Using the Terminal, ensure you are in the <code>recipe-page</code> directory.</p>
<p>Visit <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/">the Bootstrap download page</a>. Copy and paste the CSS link into the proper place in <code>index.html</code>.</p>
<p>Refresh <code>index.html</code> in Chrome by pressing <code>&lt;COMMAND&gt; + r</code>. Your webpage should, more or less, look the same as it did before. You might notice that the non-header font is different. No problem.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>If your image is no longer aligned with the header for your instructions, simply remove the <code>margin-left</code> declaration from your <code>.left</code> class in <code>styles.css</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>If your <code>.left</code> div is right along the left side of the screen, with no blank space as a buffer, go ahead and add <code>margin-left: 20px;</code> as a declaration in the <code>body</code> selector of <code>styles.css</code>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>If something is really out of place, see if you can fix it by adjusting the margins or another aspect of the Box Model.</p>
<p>When you’re that you’ve properly linked to the Boostrap CSS CDN, run <code>git status</code>. Add and commit, making sure to write a descriptive commit message in the present tense, such as “Add Bootstrap CSS.”</p>
<h4 id="part-2---add-column-classes-to-your-divs-to-make-the-webpage-responsive">Part 2 - Add column classes to your divs to make the webpage responsive</h4>
<p>While the Chrome tab that is rendering <code>index.html</code> is open, open the Developer Tools. Click on the mobile device icon (shown below) so you can see what your web page will look like on a cell phone. You can use the dropdown menu to change the style of phone or tablet, and thus change the mock-up screen size.</p>
<p><img src="" /></p>
<p>While your webpage might look OK, it’s likely that your headers are getting cut off or that there are other minor adjustments that need to be made. That’s because we haven’t told <code>index.html</code> to take up the whole width of the screen, whatever size it may be. We can do this by pasting this <code>&lt;meta&gt;</code> tag into the <code>&lt;header&gt;</code> tags:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode html"><code class="sourceCode html"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-1" title="1"><span class="kw">&lt;meta</span><span class="ot"> name=</span><span class="st">&quot;viewport&quot;</span><span class="ot"> content=</span><span class="st">&quot;width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0&quot;</span> <span class="kw">/&gt;</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>Save the file, then refresh <code>index.html</code> in Chrome by pressing <code>&lt;COMMAND&gt; + r</code>. Your cell-phone mockup should look a lot better now!</p>
<p><img src="" /></p>
<p>Do you remember how to tell Bootstrap to allow a div to take up a certain number of columns? On a small screen, we usually want divs to take up all 12 columns so things are as large as possible. Let’s add the <code>col-xs-12</code> class to the divs that currently have the <code>top</code>, <code>left</code> and <code>right</code> classes. (Remember, elements may have more than one class!) Here’s an abbreviated example:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="sourceCode html"><code class="sourceCode html"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb2-1" title="1"><span class="kw">&lt;div</span><span class="ot"> class=</span><span class="st">&quot;top col-xs-12&quot;</span><span class="kw">&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb2-2" title="2"><span class="kw">&lt;div</span><span class="ot"> class=</span><span class="st">&quot;left col-xs-12&quot;</span><span class="kw">&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb2-3" title="3"><span class="kw">&lt;div</span><span class="ot"> class=</span><span class="st">&quot;right col-xs-12&quot;</span><span class="kw">&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> <code>col-xs-*</code> have been dropped in Bootstrap 4 in favor of <code>col-*</code>.</p>
<p>Replace <code>col-xs-12</code> with <code>col-12</code> and it will work as expected.</p>
<p>Also note <code>col-xs-offset-{n}</code> were replaced by <code>offset-{n}</code> in v4.</p>
<p>When you’re satisfied with your new column classes, run <code>git status</code>. Add and commit, making sure to write a descriptive commit message in the present tense, such as “Specify column widths.”</p>
<h4 id="part-3---containers-for-the-navigation-bar-and-content">Part 3 - Containers for the Navigation Bar and Content</h4>
<p>You learned in the video lesson that Bootstrap requires all content to be inside containers. Let’s add those now. We typically use a fluid container for the navbar and a regular container for the other content. Be sure to maintain proper indentation.</p>
<p>You can refresh the webpage in Chrome but there won’t be any obvious changes to the layout.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre class="sourceCode html"><code class="sourceCode html"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb3-1" title="1"><span class="kw">&lt;body&gt;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb3-2" title="2">  <span class="kw">&lt;div</span><span class="ot"> class=</span><span class="st">&quot;container-fluid&quot;</span><span class="kw">&gt;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb3-3" title="3">    <span class="co">&lt;!-- navbar code will go here (Step 4) --&gt;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb3-4" title="4">  <span class="kw">&lt;/div&gt;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb3-5" title="5"></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb3-6" title="6">  <span class="kw">&lt;div</span><span class="ot"> class=</span><span class="st">&quot;container&quot;</span><span class="kw">&gt;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb3-7" title="7">    <span class="co">&lt;!-- all your current HTML body code goes here --&gt;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb3-8" title="8">  <span class="kw">&lt;/div&gt;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb3-9" title="9"><span class="kw">&lt;/body&gt;</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>When you’re satisfied with the placement and indentation of the containers, run <code>git status</code>. Add and commit, making sure to write a descriptive commit message in the present tense, such as “Add navbar and main content containers.”</p>
<h4 id="part-4---add-a-navigation-bar-to-the-top-of-your-webpage">Part 4 - Add a navigation bar to the top of your webpage</h4>
<p>Visit <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/navbar/">the Bootstrap Navigation Bar page</a>. Skim through the documentation to get a sense of what this component does and how to implement it (you don’t need to read everything).</p>
<p>When you have a good understanding of how the navbar works, read through <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/navbar/#supported-content">the HTML example code in this section</a>. There are a lot of class names in the code that you’re probably unfamiliar with. These are Bootstrap-specific classes that have special functionality. Once you mostly understand this code, copy and paste it into the <code>container-fluid</code> div in <code>index.html</code></p>
<p><img src="" /></p>
<p>Refresh <code>index.html</code> in Chrome by pressing <code>&lt;COMMAND&gt; + r</code>. You should now see the example navbar on your page! Is there a difference in how your navbar appears on the mobile screen version vs. the laptop screen version?</p>
<p>When you’re satisfied with the placement and styling of the navigation bar, run <code>git status</code>. Add and commit, making sure to write a descriptive commit message in the present tense, such as “Add and style navbar.”</p>
<p>Let’s clean up the navbar a little bit. You can remove things like the search bar, the drop down menu, etc. Just leave the “Brand” and a page link or two. You can customize the colors using CSS to suit your theme! Add and commit your changes with a useful commit message.</p>
