<p>Pair programming is a very common way to write code and to solve software engineering problems. Pair programming generally produces higher-quality code, meaning fewer bugs and better readability.</p>

<p>“If you don’t like pairing, don’t pair. But be prepared for the folks who have developed the pairing skill to fly past you.” <a href="https://twitter.com/unclebobmartin/status/1208576162126917638?s=19">- “Uncle” Bob Martin</a></p>

<h3 id="common-mistakes-misconceptions">Common Mistakes / Misconceptions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>“I could be doing this so much faster on my own.”</strong> Sometimes, this is true. But a big drawback to coding on your own is that you’re far less likely to catch bugs early on. And, since no one is checking your code, the readability of code you write in isolation may not be as good as the readability of code you wrote with someone else. So while you may be able to write code more quickly when coding on your own, the time it takes to work through bugs on your own usually negates this advantage.</li>
<li><strong>“Real programmers do not program in pairs.”</strong> Some companies exclusively use pair programming (<a href="https://pivotal.io/labs">Pivotal Labs</a> is one such example). Many companies use pair programming at certain times or in certain situations. Some companies don’t practice pair programming at all.</li>
<li><strong>“I don’t know what’s going on or what my pair is doing, so I’m just going to sit back and watch them.”</strong> Pair programming is not pair programming when only one person is doing the work. Speak up and advocate for yourself. Ask questions and stay involved! If you need a break to reset your mind, ask for one.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="group-practice">Group Practice</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Collaboratively come up with a list of questions to ask your pair partner before you begin a pair programming session together. Write these down for later reference.</p></li>
<li><p>Collaboratively edit your questions list at the end of your pairing.</p></li>
</ol>

<li>Keeping your personal notes and reminders online is a great technique to organize things and keep yourself sane. If you don’t already have your own solution, save your notes from group practice with one of these apps:
