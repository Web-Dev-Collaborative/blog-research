<h2 id="setup-instructions">Setup Instructions</h2>
<p>Use the Terminal for navigating around the file system and creating new folders and files. Refer to the lesson on <a href="https://github.com/Techtonica/curriculum/blob/main/command-line/command-line-interface.md">The Command Line Interface</a> if you need guidance on using the Terminal.</p>
<p>When you get to the steps below that ask you to initialize a git repo and track files using git, refer to the lesson on <a href="../git/git-version-control.md">Git and Version Control</a> if you need guidance.</p>
<p>If you do not yet have a directory called <code>techtonica-projects</code> on your Desktop, create one now using the Terminal.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Navigate to the <code>techtonica-projects</code> directory.</li>
<li>Create a new directory called <code>recipe-page</code> within the <code>techtonica-projects</code> directory.</li>
<li>Navigate to the <code>recipe-page</code> directory.</li>
<li>Initialize recipe-page as a git repo.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you have questions, do not disturb your colleagues until you have spent at least 20 minutes troubleshooting on your own. Be sure to format your question using the template we practiced in the <a href="https://github.com/Techtonica/curriculum/blob/main/asking-good-questions/asking-good-questions.md">Asking Good Questions</a> lesson.</p>
<h2 id="lab-exercise">Lab Exercise</h2>
<h4 id="part-1---create-an-html-file-open-it-in-vscode">Part 1 - Create an HTML file &amp; open it in VSCode</h4>
<p>Using the Terminal, ensure you are in the <code>recipe-page</code> directory. Create a new file in this directory called <code>index.html</code>. Open this file in VSCode using the Terminal shortcut to do so.</p>
<h4 id="part-2---code-the-basic-html-structure">Part 2 - Code the basic HTML structure</h4>
<p>Using the <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1sqmplQtQw0KfC64VGL8Ur8NWOtyeUvSVYN407lJvjzY/edit?usp=sharing">HTML lesson slides</a> or another online resource, code only the most essential elements for an HTML page (the basic structure). Create a reasonable title given the recipe you are going to showcase. Do not include any code within the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> tags yet.</p>
<p>Navigate to the <code>recipe-page</code> directory and run <code>git status</code>. You should see changes that need to be added and committed. Add and commit them, making sure to write a descriptive commit message in the present tense, such as “Code basic HTML structure.”</p>
<h4 id="part-3---add-the-title-of-the-recipe-to-the-body">Part 3 - Add the title of the recipe to the body</h4>
<p>Using either the <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> header tags, create a header within the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> tags that displays the title of your recipe.</p>
<p>Open <code>index.html</code> in Chrome to verify that this works.</p>
<p>Once you can see that adding the title worked, run <code>git status</code>. You should see changes that need to be added and committed. Add and commit them, making sure to write a descriptive commit message in the present tense, such as “Add recipe title.”</p>

</figure>
<h4 id="part-4---add-a-brief-background-or-blurb-about-the-recipe">Part 4 - Add a brief background or blurb about the recipe</h4>
<p>Using the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> paragraph tags, write a little blurb or background story about the recipe underneath the title. It doesn’t need to be long; a few sentences will do. Don’t worry about how the text looks on the webpage. We’ll make things more readable when we style the text with CSS in Phase 2 of the project!</p>
<p>Refresh <code>index.html</code> in Chrome by pressing <code>&lt;COMMAND&gt; + r</code>.</p>
<p>Once you can see that adding the blurb worked, run <code>git status</code>. You should see changes that need to be added and committed. Add and commit them, making sure to write a descriptive commit message in the present tense, such as “Add recipe description.”</p>

<h4 id="part-5---add-an-unordered-list-of-ingredients">Part 5 - Add an unordered list of ingredients</h4>
<p>Using the <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> unordered list tags and the <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> list item tags, list the ingredients in the order that they will be used in the recipe. Be sure to include the amount you need of each ingredient!</p>
<p>Refresh <code>index.html</code> in Chrome by pressing <code>&lt;COMMAND&gt; + r</code> to make sure the list appears as you intended.</p>
<figure>
<img src="./screenshots/step5-ingredients.png" alt="Image of webpage after adding ingredients" /><figcaption>Image of webpage after adding ingredients</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Run <code>git status</code>. You should see changes that need to be added and committed. Add and commit them, making sure to write a descriptive commit message in the present tense, such as “Add list of ingredients.”</p>
<h4 id="part-6---add-an-ordered-list-of-the-steps-required-to-make-the-dish">Part 6 - Add an ordered list of the steps required to make the dish</h4>
<p>Using the <code>&lt;ol&gt;</code> ordered list tags and the <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> list item tags, list the steps that are involved in creating the dish.</p>
<ul>
<li>If there are distinct parts to the recipe, such as “make frosting” and “make the cupcakes”, feel free to use sub-headings and multiple ordered lists to clearly show which steps go with which parts of the recipe.</li>
</ul>
<p>Refresh <code>index.html</code> in Chrome by pressing <code>&lt;COMMAND&gt; + r</code>.</p>
<p>Once you can see that adding the list of steps worked, run <code>git status</code>. You should see changes that need to be added and committed. Add and commit them, making sure to write a descriptive commit message in the present tense, such as “Add recipe instructions.”</p>

<h4 id="part-7---add-at-least-one-image">Part 7 - Add at least one image</h4>
<p>Using the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> image tag, add an image between the blurb and the list of ingredients.</p>
<pre>
This should be an image you find online. Do a Google search for "(name of dish) image",
like "spaghetti image". Click on the "Images" tab in the upper left (it's just to the
right of "All"). When you find an image you like, click on it to see a larger version.
Make sure that the width of the image is at least 600 pixels. Then, click on the
"View Image" button. Doing this will open a new tab that contains  only the image.
Copy the URL that appears in the search bar -- this is the URL you can  use inside the
`src` attribute of your `img` tag!
</pre>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/lTJWBagWE4c">Here’s a short video that walks you through the steps given above</a>.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>You’ll need to use the <code>src</code> attribute inside the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag in order to specify the URL where the image is hosted.</li>
<li>Specify the width of the image to be 600px using the <code>"width"</code> attribute.</li>
</ol>
<p>Underneath the image, include a photo credit that links to the source of the image. This just means to link to the main website that originally posted the image. It could be a food blogger’s website or something similar. Hint: You’ll need to use a combination of tags for this! You can find the URL of the image’s owner by clicking on the “Visit” button instead of the “View Image” button:</p>

</figure>
<figure>
<img src="./screenshots/step7-image.png" alt="Image of webpage after adding image and photo credit" /><figcaption>Image of webpage after adding image and photo credit</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Run <code>git status</code>. You should see changes that need to be added and committed. Add and commit them, making sure to write a descriptive commit message in the present tense, such as “Add image and image credit.”</p>
<h4 id="part-8---add-links-to-similar-recipes-you-found-online">Part 8 - Add links to similar recipes you found online</h4>
<p>Place at least 2 links to similar recipes online underneath the recipe’s instructions. Refresh the webpage to make sure it worked.</p>
<figure>
<img src="./screenshots/step8-other-recipes.png" alt="Image of webpage after adding links to similar recipes" /><figcaption>Image of webpage after adding links to similar recipes</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Once you can see that adding the external links worked, run <code>git status</code>. You should see changes that need to be added and committed. Add and commit them, making sure to write a descriptive commit message in the present tense, such as “Add links to more recipes.”</p>
<h4 id="part-9---add-some-divs-for-easy-css-integration-later">Part 9 - Add some <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>s for easy CSS integration later</h4>
<p>Wrap each section (listed below) in its own pair of <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> tags:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The title and blurb/description. Give this div the class <code>top</code>.</li>
<li>The image(s) and photo credit(s)</li>
<li>The list of ingredients</li>
<li>The list of steps required to make the dish</li>
<li>The external links to similar recipes</li>
</ol>
<p>Make sure you maintain the proper levels of indentation after adding the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> tags!</p>
<p>Let’s do another layer of <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>s so we can ultimately use CSS to form this layout:</p>

<ol start="6" type="1">
<li>Create another <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> that wraps around both the image/photo credit div and the ingredients div. Give this new, outer <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> the class <code>left</code>. It should look similar to this:</li>
</ol>
