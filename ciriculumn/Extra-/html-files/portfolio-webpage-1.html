<h3 id="primary-goals">Primary Goals</h3>
<p>To demonstrate understanding of the topics covered in the first two weeks of this course.</p>
<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>In this project, you will build a simple portfolio page to practice what you’ve learned about VSCode, HTML, CSS, Git, and Bootstrap. This should take about 3 hours.</p>
<h3 id="context">Context</h3>
<ul>
<li>A great portfolio page will be valuable way to showcase your skills as you look for engineering work.</li>
<li>After you’ve learned more coding skills and tools, you will be making this site even better.</li>
<li>Include your new coding skills in your resume!</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="motivation">Motivation</h3>
<p>Increase your job prospects dramatically with your own personal web page. Get creative and show off your technical skills. Employers will love you! Here’s a list of example portfolios https://github.com/HackathonHackers/personal-sites</p>
<h3 id="starter-code">Starter Code</h3>
<p>There is no starter code for this project. You can do it!</p>
<h2 id="project-requirements">Project Requirements:</h2>
<ul>
<li>[ ] As you go through the lesson, commit your code in git and push to GitHub after each bolded section (or more frequently if you want). You should write clear + informative commit messages for each commit.</li>
</ul>
