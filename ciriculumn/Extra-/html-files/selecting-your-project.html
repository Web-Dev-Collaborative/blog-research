<h1 id="selecting-your-project">Selecting Your Project</h1>
<p>This is your chance to come up with pie-in-the-sky ideas including overly-ambitious projects. After you come up with your list, youâ€™ll pare it down, and likely simplify the goals to make it more approachable.</p>
<h2 id="inspiration">Inspiration</h2>
<ul>
<li>Reflect on your day-to-day: where do you see an opportunity for an optimization or an improvement?
<ul>
<li>An old product development trick is to observer users creating their own systems and then turning it into an app</li>
<li>For example, roommates might keep a shared doc of pantry items they run out of to use when grocery shopping - could this be a dedicated app?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Current VC-funded apps tend to address the needs of wealthy white consumers with high disposable incomes so they can trade money for free time
<ul>
<li>Think of other markets more related to your and your familyâ€™s life experiences</li>
<li>Who is not being served by current apps? What needs do they have that are different that the assumptions baked into current apps?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>What do you think about a lot? What adds friction to your life or those you see around you?</li>
<li>Consider whether to make a feature into a standalone project. Look at some of your favorite apps, sites, or products. Can you re-purpose and improve upon one of its features?</li>
<li>As a Techtonica participantâ€¦
<ul>
<li>What is a tool that could be useful for future participants?</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Analyzing Data</strong>
<ul>
<li>Is there a dataset you would love to dive into?</li>
<li>What questions do you have about your city or locale? Could data answer it?</li>
<li><a href="https://datasf.org/">DataSF</a> - hosts free data about the city</li>
<li>Many popular apps have APIs or offline anonymized datasets for student research</li>
</ul></li>

<h3 id="idea-generation---alone">Idea Generation - Alone</h3>
<ul>
<li>Despite popular opinion, thinking alone produces <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/01/30/groupthink">better ideas than group brainstorming</a></li>
<li>Put yourself into FLOW MODE (mute slack, etc)
<ul>
<li>Using paper is likely best</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Review the above criteria</li>
<li>Check out the sample idea list</li>
<li>Set a 5 minute timer on your phone
<ul>
<li>Write down as many ideas as you can think of</li>
<li>Using paper may actually be better</li>
<li>Donâ€™t go into detail, just give them short names</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Use a new sheet of paper. Set another 5 minute timeer
<ul>
<li>Write down another set of ideas</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Repeat as needed until you have ~20 ideas</li>
<li>Put them in a markdown doc - add some notes to each so someone else reading has a basic idea of what you meant</li>
<li>Create a Gist and Slack URL to the Seam</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="idea-generation---pair">Idea Generation - Pair</h3>
<ul>
<li>Review your pairâ€™s list from the solo exercise</li>
<li>Synchronously in-person or over VC, set a strict <strong>5 minute timer</strong></li>
<li>Come up with more ideas
<ul>
<li>these can be variations of your pairâ€™s idea (Like your X but with Y)</li>
<li>they can be something that combines an idea from your list with an idea from your pairâ€™s list</li>
<li>they can also just be unrelated ideas</li>
</ul></li>
<li>After the 5 minutes, read them off and explain them</li>
<li>Tell your pair which of their ideas is your favorite youâ€™d most want to steal</li>
<li>Create a Gist and Slack URL to the Seam</li>
</ul>
