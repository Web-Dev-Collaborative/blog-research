<h3 id="primary-goals">Primary Goals</h3>
<ul>
<li>Practice writing tests with Jasmine</li>
<li>Catch any bugs in your project’s object-oriented code</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>Now that you’ve finished Part 1 and your Event Recommender class is complete, you’ll write Jasmine tests to ensure your code works as expected.</p>
<h3 id="instructions-for-adding-tests">Instructions for adding tests</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>Go back to your EventRecommender file where User, Event, and EventRecommender classes are defined, and refamiliarize yourself with what you did there. We will be adding <em>Jasmine tests</em> for each function defined in your EventRecommender. At the bottom of that file, add the line: <code>module.exports = { EventRecommender, User, Event}</code> This line enables other JS files to use the classes you defined. If your classes are named differently, update that line to match the classes you wrote.</li>
<li>Run <code>npm install jasmine -g</code> (it will install Jasmine globally)</li>
<li>In your project root, run <code>jasmine init</code> (it will initialize Jasmine in your project, creates <code>jasmine.json</code> with Jasmine settings)</li>
<li>In the new <code>spec</code> folder created after you ran <code>jasmine init</code>, make a new file called <code>eventRecommenderSpec.js</code> and copy the code from <a href="starter-code/eventRecommenderSpec.js">this file</a> into it.</li>
<li>In your project root, run <code>jasmine</code> (it will start your tests).</li>
<li>A lot of them will fail, and your challenge is to fix them. Debug why the tests are failing and update the Jasmine code and/or your classes to make the tests pass. Every time you make a fix, run <code>jasmine</code> again to check your tests. This might take a while but is good practice for debugging both your tests and your code.</li>
<li>When you get the existing tests working, add tests for <code>findEventsByDate</code> and <code>findEventsByCategory</code></li>
<li>Add at least one more test of your choice. What else could be useful to test in your code?</li>
</ol>
