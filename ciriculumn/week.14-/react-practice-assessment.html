<h1 id="react-practice-assessment-project---surveys">React Practice Assessment Project - Surveys</h1>
<p>This project is designed to let you stretch your skills as a developer. Rather than a step-by-step guide, you will find a specification as if it came from a client you might be working for.</p>
<p>The goal is to allow you to prepare to show off your skills in these areas</p>

<h2 id="specifications">Specifications</h2>
<p>The a/A Forms company has engaged your services to replace their existing survey website with a new <em>React</em> application. Initially, they would like to release a minimum of two surveys. They are also requesting a home page for the site and navigation to the available surveys.</p>
<ul>
<li>Home page</li>
<li>Navigation</li>
<li>The Sample Survey they use with new prospective customers
<ul>
<li>Has a variety of question types
<ul>
<li>Multiple choice question (<code>mcq</code>) means use <em>radio button</em> inputs</li>
<li>Constructed response (<code>cr</code>) on a single-line means a standard text input</li>
<li>Constructed response (<code>cr</code>) with mulitle lines means a text area</li>
<li>You can choose to ignore <code>size</code>, <code>charlimit</code> and <code>pagebreak</code>, as these are considered bonus features</li>
</ul></li>
<li>A simple “Thank you” message shows when submitted (no redirection)</li>
<li>Validation should be used to prevent the form from submitting if any of the non-optional (a.k.a. required) fields don’t have an answer</li>
<li>Questions and survey information included in the <em>sample.json</em> asset file</li>
<li><em>Bonus</em>
<ul>
<li>Include one more question in the sample survey for “Employee Number”, and obscure the entered text so no one can see the characters that are being typed. &gt; Hint: Think about password fields.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>A Sensory Preferences Survey
<ul>
<li>A 25 question assessment they allow teachers to share with their students for free which helps them better understand their learning style</li>
<li>All questions have the same set of answers:
<ul>
<li>Strongly Disagree (1 point)</li>
<li>Disagree (2 points)</li>
<li>Neutral (3 points)</li>
<li>Agree (4 points)</li>
<li>Strongly Agree (5 points)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Questions and survey information included in the <em>spi.json</em> asset file</li>
<li>You can choose to ignore <code>pagebreak</code>, as this is considered a bonus feature</li>
<li>Answers should be processed, and a summary of the results displayed automatically on submit of the survey (redirect to a report page on submission)
<ul>
<li>Every third question has the same topic</li>
<li>Add up the points for each topic and calculate a percentage relative to the total selected points</li>
<li>Show the highest percentage item first, next highest in the middle, and lowest at the bottom (see wireframe)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="provided-assets">Provided assets</h2>
<p>Download the <a href="https://appacademy-open-assets.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/Modular-Curriculum/content/react-redux/assessments/practice/assets.zip">assets</a> here. Included in the assets folder are the following files:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><em>logo.png</em> - Company logo</li>
<li><em>sample.json</em> - JSON file exported from their current system with the first survey on their list</li>
<li><em>spi.json</em> - JSON file from their current system with the inventory questions</li>
<li>_bonus.json - Another JSON file in case you want to do more (see below)</li>
<li><em>Home Page WF.png</em> - General concept client is looking for. Use “Lorem Ipsum” for the text (search online if you don’t remember what that is)</li>
<li><em>SPI Report WF.png</em> - General concept they are looking for</li>
</ol>
<p>You can choose to use to use the JSON files as mock data, if you’d like. However, the client is fine with copy and paste as well.</p>
<h2 id="the-approach">The approach</h2>
<p>The first step is to use <code>create-react-app</code> to get the framework of your application setup quickly. The goal is more important than the order of the steps, so you should feel free to switch which part of the application you are working on if you get stuck. A few suggestions are provided here.</p>
<p>Tool suggestions (not a complete list, and you may find better ways!)</p>
<ul>
<li>Function components with hooks</li>
<li><code>react-router-dom</code> - <code>BrowserRouter</code> and its related pieces, <code>NavLink</code></li>
<li><code>useState</code> and possibly <code>useRef</code> and <code>useEffect</code> for form validation</li>
<li><code>useState</code> for showing thank you message on sample form submit</li>
<li><code>useHistory</code> for navigating to the report page on sensory preferences survey submission</li>
<li><code>useContext</code> for sharing answers between sensory preferences survey, and the corresponding report</li>
<li><code>Redirect</code> for navigating away from the report page when there are no results</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="option-red---go-wide">Option Red - Go Wide</h2>
<p>Create components with minimal content quickly, setup <code>react-router-dom</code> to navigate to them. Then go through each one and put in basic content, go back to each and add form validation, repeat until all features are complete.</p>
<h2 id="option-blue---go-deep">Option Blue - Go Deep</h2>
<p>Create one component. Import it into the <em>App.js</em>. Build out all its features, e.g. survey questions, then validation, then submit. Replace the component in <em>App.js</em> with another one and repeat the process. At the end (or in the middle, if you prefer), bring in <code>react-router-dom</code> and configure it for navigation.</p>
<h2 id="bonus-survey">Bonus Survey</h2>
<p>If you want to go above and beyond, then research the “Likert scale” online and add another page for the survey questions found in <em>bonus.json</em>. Include a simple thank-you message on submit, if you’d like.</p>
