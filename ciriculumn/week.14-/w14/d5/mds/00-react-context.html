<p>You’ve been using a component’s state and props to manage the information rendered in your React applications. However, applications generally use global state to share the same information across multiple components. After reading and practicing how to use React Context, you should be able to manage application-wide data by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use Context to share and manage global information within a React application</li>
<li>Create a wrapper component with <code>Context.Provider</code> to set a component’s default context</li>
<li>Create a wrapper component with <code>Context.Consumer</code> to share the global context through render props</li>
<li>Create and pass a method through Context to update the global state from a nested component</li>
</ul>
