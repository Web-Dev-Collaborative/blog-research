<h1 id="react-builds">React Builds</h1>
<p>A “build” is the process of converting code into something that can actually execute or run on the target platform. A “front-end build” is a process of preparing a front-end or client-side application for the browser.</p>
<p>With React applications, that means (at a minimum) converting JSX to something that browsers can actually understand. When using Create React App, the build process is automatically configured to do that and a lot more.</p>
<p>When you finish this article, you should be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Describe what front-end builds are and why they’re needed;</li>
<li>Describe at a high level what happens in a Create React App when you run <code>npm start</code>; and</li>
<li>Prepare to deploy a React application into a production environment.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="understanding-front-end-builds">Understanding front-end builds</h2>
<p>The need for front-end builds predates React. Over the years, developers have found it helpful to extend the lowest common denominator version of JavaScript and CSS that they could use.</p>
<p>Sometimes developers extend JavaScript and CSS with something like <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a> or <a href="https://sass-lang.com/">Sass</a>. Using these non-standard languages and syntaxes require you to use a build process to convert your code into standard JavaScript and CSS that can actually run in the browser.</p>
<p>Browser-based applications also require a fair amount of optimization to deliver the best, or at least acceptable, experience to end users. Front-end build processes could be configured to lint code, run unit tests, optimize images, minify and bundle code, and more–all automatically at the press of a button (i.e. running a command at the terminal).</p>
<h3 id="javascript-versions-and-the-growth-of-front-end-builds">JavaScript versions and the growth of front-end builds</h3>
<p>Developers are generally an impatient lot. When new features are added to JavaScript, we don’t like to wait for browsers to widely support those features before we start to use them in our code. And we <em>really</em> don’t like when we have to support older, legacy versions of browsers.</p>
<p>In recent years, JavaScript has been updated on a yearly basis and browser vendors do a decent job of updating their browsers to support the new features as they’re added to the language. Years ago though, there was an infamous delay between versions 5 and 6 of JavaScript. It took <em>years</em> before ES6 (or ES2015 as it eventually was renamed to) to officially be completed and even longer before browsers supported all of its features.</p>
<p>In the period of time before ES2015 was broadly supported by browsers, developers used front-end builds to convert or <em>transpile</em> ES2015 features and syntax to an older version of the language that was more broadly supported by browsers (typically ES5). The transpilation from ES2015/ES6 down to ES5 was one of the major drivers for developers to add front-end builds to their client-side projects.</p>
<h3 id="reviewing-common-terminology">Reviewing common terminology</h3>
<p>When learning about front-end or React builds, you’ll encounter a lot of terminology that you may or may not be familiar with. Here’s some of the terminology that you’ll likely encounter:</p>
<p><strong>Linting</strong> is process of using a tool to analyze your code to catch common programming errors, bugs, stylistic inconsistencies, and suspicious coding patterns. <a href="https://eslint.org/">ESLint</a> is a popular JavaScript linting tool.</p>
<p><strong>Transpilation</strong> is the process of converting source code, like JavaScript, from one version to another version. Usually this means converting newer versions of JavaScript, <a href="https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/10.0/index.html">ES2019</a> or <a href="https://tc39.es/ecma262/">ES2021</a>, to a version that’s more widely supported by browsers, like <a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/">ES2015</a>, or even <a href="https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/">ES5</a> or <a href="https://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST-ARCH/ECMA-262,%203rd%20edition,%20December%201999.pdf">ES3</a> (if you need to support the browser that your parents or grandparents use).</p>
<p><strong>Minification</strong> is the process of removing all unnecessary characters in your code (e.g. white space characters, new line characters, comments) to produce an overall smaller file. Minification tools will often also rename identifers in your code (i.e. parameter and variable names) in the quest for smaller and smaller file sizes. Source maps can also be generated to allow debugging tools to cross reference between minified code and the original source code.</p>
<p><strong>Bundling</strong> is the process of combining multiple code files into a single file. Creating a bundle (or a handful of bundles) reduces the number of requests that a client needs to make to the server.</p>
<p><strong>Tree shaking</strong> is the process of removing unused (or dead) code from your application before it’s bundled. Tree shaking external dependencies can sometimes have a dramatic positive impact on overall bundled file sizes.</p>
<h3 id="configuration-or-code">Configuration or code?</h3>
<p>Front-end build tools have come and gone over the years; sometimes very quickly, which helped bring about the phenomenon known as <a href="https://sdtimes.com/softwaredev/is-the-javascript-fatigue-real/">JavaScript fatigue</a>.</p>
<p>Configuration based tools allow you to create your build tasks by declaring (usually using JSON, XML, or YAML) what you want to be done, without explicitly writing every step in the process. In contrast, coding or scripting based tools allow you to, well, write code to create your build tasks. Configuration based tools <em>can</em> sometimes feel simpler to use while giving up some control (at least initially) while coding based tools <em>can</em> feel more familiar and predictable (since you’re describing tasks procedurally). Every generalization is false though (including this one), so there are plenty of exceptions.</p>
<p><a href="https://gruntjs.com/">Grunt</a> is a JSON configuration based task runner that can be used to orchestrate the various tasks that make up your front-end build. Grunt was very quickly supplanted by <a href="https://gulpjs.com/">Gulp</a>, which allowed developers to write JavaScript to define front-end build tasks. After Gulp, the front-end tooling landscape became a bit more muddled. Some developers preferred the simplicity of using <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts">npm scripts</a> to define build tasks while others preferred the power of configuration based bundlers like <a href="https://webpack.js.org/">webpack</a>.</p>
<h3 id="babel-and-webpack-yes-thats-intentionally-a-lowercase-w">Babel and webpack (yes, that’s intentionally a lowercase ‘w’)</h3>
<p>As front-end or client-side applications grew in complexity, developers found themselves wanting to leverage more advanced JavaScript features and newer syntax like classes, arrow functions, destructuring, async/await, etc. Using a code transpiler, like <a href="https://babeljs.io/">Babel</a>, allows you to use all of the latest and greatest features and syntax without worrying about what browsers support what.</p>
<p>Module loaders and bundlers, like <a href="https://webpack.js.org/">webpack</a>, also allowed developers to use JavaScript modules without requiring users to use a browser that natively supports ES modules. Also, module bundling (along with minification and tree-shaking) helps to reduce the bandwidth that’s required to deliver the assets for your application to the client.</p>
<p>[Create React App][cra] uses webpack (along with Babel) under the covers to build your React applications. Even if you’re not using Create React App, webpack and Babel are still very popular choices for building React applications.</p>
<h2 id="pulling-back-the-covers-a-bit-on-the-create-react-app-build-process">Pulling back the covers (a bit) on the Create React App build process</h2>
<p>Running an application created by Create React App using <code>npm start</code> can feel magical. Some stuff happens in the terminal and your application opens into your default browser. Even better, when you make changes to your application, your changes will (usually) automatically appear in the browser!</p>
<h3 id="the-create-react-app-build-process">The Create React App build process</h3>
<p>At a high level, here’s what happens when you run <code>npm start</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Environment variables are loaded (more about this in a bit);</li>
<li>The list of browsers to support are checked (more about this too in a bit);</li>
<li>The configured HTTP port is checked to ensure that it’s available;</li>
<li>The application compiler is configured and created;</li>
<li><a href="https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/"><code>webpack-dev-server</code></a> is started;</li>
<li><a href="https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/"><code>webpack-dev-server</code></a> compiles your application;</li>
<li>The <code>index.html</code> file is loaded into the browser; and</li>
<li>A file watcher is started to watch your files, waiting for changes.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="ejecting">Ejecting</h3>
<p>Create React App provides a script that you can run to “eject” your application from the Create React App tooling. When you eject your application, all of the hidden stuff is exposed so that you can review and customize it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The need to customize Create React App rarely happens. Also, don’t eject an actual project as it’s a one-way trip! Once a Create React App project has been ejected, there’s no going back (though you could always undo the ejection process by reverting to an earlier commit if you’re using source control).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To eject your application from Create React App, run the command <code>npm run eject</code>. You’ll be prompted if you want to continue; type “y” to continue with the ejection process. Once the ejection process has completed, you can review the files that were previously hidden from you.</p>
<p>In the <code>package.json</code> file, you’ll see the following npm scripts:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode json"><code class="sourceCode json"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-1" title="1"><span class="fu">{</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-2" title="2">  <span class="dt">&quot;scripts&quot;</span><span class="fu">:</span> <span class="fu">{</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-3" title="3">    <span class="dt">&quot;start&quot;</span><span class="fu">:</span> <span class="st">&quot;node scripts/start.js&quot;</span><span class="fu">,</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-4" title="4">    <span class="dt">&quot;build&quot;</span><span class="fu">:</span> <span class="st">&quot;node scripts/build.js&quot;</span><span class="fu">,</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-5" title="5">    <span class="dt">&quot;test&quot;</span><span class="fu">:</span> <span class="st">&quot;node scripts/test.js&quot;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-6" title="6">  <span class="fu">}</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-7" title="7"><span class="fu">}</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>You can open the <code>./scripts/start.js</code> file to see the code that’s executed when you run <code>npm start</code>.</p>
<p>If you’re curious about the webpack configuration, you can open and review the <code>./config/webpack.config.js</code>.</p>
<h2 id="preparing-to-deploy-a-react-application-for-production">Preparing to deploy a React application for production</h2>
<p>Before you deploy your application to production, you’ll want to make sure that you’ve replaced static values in your code with environment variables and considered what browsers you need to support.</p>
<h3 id="defining-environment-variables">Defining environment variables</h3>
<p>Create React App supports defining environment variables in an <code>.env</code> file. To define an environment variable, add an <code>.env</code> file to your project and define one or more variables that start with the prefix <code>REACT_APP_</code>:</p>
<pre><code>REACT_APP_FOO: some value
REACT_APP_BAR: another value</code></pre>
<p>Environment variables can be used in code like this:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb3-1" title="1"><span class="va">console</span>.<span class="at">log</span>(<span class="va">process</span>.<span class="va">env</span>.<span class="at">REACT_APP_FOO</span>)<span class="op">;</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>You can also reference environment variables in your <code>index.html</code> like this:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4"><pre class="sourceCode html"><code class="sourceCode html"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb4-1" title="1"><span class="kw">&lt;title&gt;</span>%REACT_APP_BAR%<span class="kw">&lt;/title&gt;</span></a></code></pre></div>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> Environment variables are embedded into your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript bundles during the build process. Because of this, it’s <em>very important</em> to not store any secrets, like API keys, in your environment variables as anyone can view your bundled code in the browser by inspecting your files.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="configuring-the-supported-browsers">Configuring the supported browsers</h3>
<p>In your project’s <code>package.json</code> file, you can see the list of targeted browsers:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb5"><pre class="sourceCode json"><code class="sourceCode json"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb5-1" title="1"><span class="fu">{</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb5-2" title="2">  <span class="dt">&quot;browserslist&quot;</span><span class="fu">:</span> <span class="fu">{</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb5-3" title="3">    <span class="dt">&quot;production&quot;</span><span class="fu">:</span> <span class="ot">[</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb5-4" title="4">      <span class="st">&quot;&gt;0.2%&quot;</span><span class="ot">,</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb5-5" title="5">      <span class="st">&quot;not dead&quot;</span><span class="ot">,</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb5-6" title="6">      <span class="st">&quot;not op_mini all&quot;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb5-7" title="7">    <span class="ot">]</span><span class="fu">,</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb5-8" title="8">    <span class="dt">&quot;development&quot;</span><span class="fu">:</span> <span class="ot">[</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb5-9" title="9">      <span class="st">&quot;last 1 chrome version&quot;</span><span class="ot">,</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb5-10" title="10">      <span class="st">&quot;last 1 firefox version&quot;</span><span class="ot">,</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb5-11" title="11">      <span class="st">&quot;last 1 safari version&quot;</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb5-12" title="12">    <span class="ot">]</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb5-13" title="13">  <span class="fu">}</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb5-14" title="14"><span class="fu">}</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>Adjusting these targets affect how your code will be transpiled. Specifying older browser versions will result in your code being transpiled to older versions of JavaScript in order to be compatible with the specified browser versions. The <code>production</code> list specifies the browsers to target when creating a production build and the <code>development</code> list specifics the browsers to target when running the application using <code>npm start</code>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://browserl.ist">browserl.ist</a> website can be used to see the browsers supported by your configured <code>browserslist</code>.</p>
<h3 id="creating-a-production-build">Creating a production build</h3>
<p>To create a production build, run the command <code>npm run build</code>. The production build process bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. When the command completes, you’ll find your production ready files in the <code>build</code> folder.</p>
<p>Now your application is ready to be deployed!</p>
