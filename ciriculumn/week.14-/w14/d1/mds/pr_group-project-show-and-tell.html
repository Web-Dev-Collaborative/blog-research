<h1 id="show-and-tell">Show And Tell</h1>
<p>It’s time to show off all of the hard work that you’ve done! Great job! You worked as a team, pushed hard through the project, coordinated, collaborated, communicated.</p>
<p>You are a real software development team!</p>
<p>Each presentation should last around 15 minutes. Some things that you may want to highlight:</p>
<ul>
<li>The way that you integrated front- and back-ends</li>
<li>Anything that you added that went beyond the bound of what you learned in class and how that went</li>
<li>Reflect on the goods and bads of the experience <em>as a team</em>, talk about what you would do differently if you could start over with all the knowledge you have, right now</li>
</ul>
