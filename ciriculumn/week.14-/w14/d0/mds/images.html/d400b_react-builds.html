After reading and practicing, you should be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Describe what frontend builds are and why they’re needed</li>
<li>Describe at a high level what happens in a Create React App when you run <code>npm start</code></li>
<li>Prepare to deploy a React application into a production environment</li>
</ul>
