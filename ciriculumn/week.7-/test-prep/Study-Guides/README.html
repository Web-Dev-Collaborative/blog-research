<ol type="1">
<li>Read the README.md CAREFULLY.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>If you have trouble with reading comprehension and making sure you get details, take notes on the important points</li>
<li>Includes:
<ul>
<li>which files that you should be modifying</li>
<li>a brief overview of the problems</li>
<li>what you shouldn’t be doing</li>
<li>submission instructions</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Have an <code>node</code> terminal open for testing little bits of code</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>check your sanity and small bits of code to see if that chunk of code is working as you expect to be working</li>
</ul>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>Read the problem statement CAREFULLY and <strong>make bulletpoints</strong> that you can use as a checklist to make sure you solve the problem the way we expect you to solve it.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Make note of the goals of the problem</li>
<li>Make note of the input to the problem (any parameters to the function? what are the inputs expected to be in the form of (like an array/string)?)</li>
<li>Make note of the output to the problem and what the output should be in a form of (array/string). If output needs to be returned, make note of that, <strong>Make sure to return using the return keyword</strong></li>
</ul>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Open up the spec file for side by side with the problem file and skim through the spec file to see what the problem is requiring you to do</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>See how the test is testing your code
<ul>
<li>How is it getting the functions/classes/variables from the problem file(s)?</li>
<li>What is it looking for in the functions/classes/variables?</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>Test your code using examples!</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>examples can be found in description or in the spec files BUT you may want to simplify the examples in them</li>
</ul>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>Run the test! Use the command to run the code specified.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Check the error messages!! Mocha shows error messages for each failed spec (If you don’t know how to do this, please ask!)</li>
</ul>
<p>Other tips: - Walk through your code with a small, condensed example if you get stuck. You may see the problem when you walk through your code using comments to the side and replacing values. Basically, execute the code like how you expect the computer to execute it using a specific input. - Use <code>console.log</code>’s by guessing what should be logged first BEFORE running the code and comparing it with what’s actually logged</p>
