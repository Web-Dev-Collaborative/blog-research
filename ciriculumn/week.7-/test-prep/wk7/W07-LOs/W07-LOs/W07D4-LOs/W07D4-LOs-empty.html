<h2 id="linked-lists-stacks-and-queues">Linked Lists, Stacks, and Queues</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Explain and implement Linked Lists.</p>
<ul>
<li>What properties does an instance of a linked list track?</li>
<li>What methods does a linked list need to implement?</li>
<li>What are the time complexities for these methods?</li>
<li>What’s the difference between a Singly Linked List and a Doubly Linked List? How would the difference impact the properties and the methods that we implement?</li>
<li>Practice creating <strong>both</strong> types. Use Thursday’s project as an example/guide.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Explain and implement a Stack.</p>
<ul>
<li>Define LIFO and ADT and how it relates</li>
<li>What methods does a stack need to implement?</li>
<li>What are the time complexities for these methods?</li>
<li>Know how to implement a stack using both a node class as well as just an array instance variable. Use Thursday’s project as an example/guide for your usage of a Node. How would this change if we just wanted to keep an array instance variable on our Stack instead?</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Explain and implement a Queue.</p>
<ul>
<li>Define FIFO and ADT and how it relates</li>
<li>What methods does a queue need to implement?</li>
<li>What are the time complexities for these methods?</li>
<li>Know how to implement a queue using both a node class as well as just an array instance variable. Use Thursday’s project as an example/guide for your usage of a Node. How would this change if we just wanted to keep an array instance variable on our Queue instead?</li>
</ul></li>
