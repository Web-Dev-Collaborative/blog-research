<h2 id="vehicle-schema-instructions">Vehicle Schema Instructions</h2>
<p>You are in charge of implementing the schema found in database-schema.png. You will implement the database using SQL. After it, you will drop the database and implement it again using Sequelize.</p>
<p>Before you start, create a user called “vehicles_app” with a password and CREATEDB privileges.</p>
<ul>
<li>SQL Practice
<ol type="1">
<li>Create a database called “vehicles” with owner “vehicles_app”</li>
<li>Create the three tables in the schema “People”, “VehicleTypes” and “Vehicles”. Ensure that you capture the associations as foreign keys in your tables</li>
<li>Create a sql file with seed data from <code>data-seed.txt</code>. Seed your database.</li>
<li>Write the following queries in SQL</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Find all People who own “Ford” “Focus”’s</li>
<li>Find all People who own Trucks</li>
<li>Find all Vehicle Types owned by “Kris”’s</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Sequelize Practice
<ol type="1">
<li>Drop the database called “vehicles”</li>
<li>Use sequelize to initialize a project</li>
<li>Update config/config.json with your “vehicles_app” user and the “vehicles” database</li>
<li>Utilize sequelize_cli model:generate to create the three Models that correspond to every table in the schema. Remember that <code>sequelize model:generate</code> takes the singular model names (“Person”, “VehicleType” and “Vehicle”) and will generate a migration file with the pluralized table names (“People”, “VehicleTypes”, and “Vehicles”).</li>
<li>Update the migrations files with validations and references</li>
<li>Update the models with the associations in the schema</li>
<li>Utilize sequelize-cli seed:generate to create seed files for each Model, and migrate the data in <code>data-seed.txt</code> into these files.</li>
<li>Create a new file called <code>queries.js</code> in the top level of your application.</li>
<li>Require your three models:</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-1" title="1">    <span class="kw">const</span> <span class="op">{</span> Person<span class="op">,</span> VehicleType<span class="op">,</span> Vehicle <span class="op">}</span> <span class="op">=</span> <span class="at">require</span>(<span class="st">&#39;./models&#39;</span>)<span class="op">;</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>Using the Sequelize query syntax, prepare three functions that will return the values specified in these queries:</p>
<pre><code>- Find all People who own &quot;Ford&quot; &quot;Focus&quot;&#39;s
- Find all People who own Trucks
- Find all Vehicle Types owned by &quot;Kris&quot;&#39;s</code></pre>
