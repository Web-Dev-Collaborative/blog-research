<h2 id="cat-schema-instructions">Cat Schema Instructions</h2>
<p>You are in charge of implementing the schema found in database-schema.png. You will implement the database using SQL. After it, you will drop the database and implement it again using Sequelize.</p>
<p>Before you start, create a user called “cats_app” with a password and CREATEDB privileges.</p>
<ul>
<li>SQL Practice
<ol type="1">
<li>Create a database called “cats” with owner “cats_app”</li>
<li>Create the three tables in the schema “Cats”, “CatToys” and “Toys”. Ensure that you capture the associations as foreign keys in your tables</li>
<li>Create a sql file with seed data from <code>data-seed.txt</code>. Seed your database.</li>
<li>Write the following queries in SQL</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Find the catId that owns the Box.</li>
<li>Find the toyId for every toy that Rocky owns.</li>
<li>Find the name of the owner for every toy.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Sequelize Practice (Bonus)
<ol type="1">
<li>Drop the database called “cats”</li>
<li>Use sequelize to initialize a project</li>
<li>Update config/config.json with your “cats_app” user and the “cats” database</li>
<li>Utilize sequelize_cli model:generate to create the three Models that correspond to every table in the schema. Remember that <code>sequelize model:generate</code> takes the singular model names (“Cat”, and “Toy”) and will generate a migration file with the pluralized table names (“Cats” and “Toys”).</li>
<li>Update the migrations files with validations and references</li>
<li>Update the models with the associations in the schema</li>
<li>Utilize sequelize-cli seed:generate to create seed files for each Model, and migrate the data in <code>data-seed.txt</code> into these files.</li>
<li>Create a new file called <code>queries.js</code> in the top level of your application.</li>
<li>Require your three models:</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode js"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb1-1" title="1">    <span class="kw">const</span> <span class="op">{</span> Cat<span class="op">,</span> Toys <span class="op">}</span> <span class="op">=</span> <span class="at">require</span>(<span class="st">&#39;./models&#39;</span>)<span class="op">;</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>Using the Sequelize query syntax, prepare three functions that will return the values specified in these queries:</p>
<pre><code>- Find the catId that owns the Box.
- Find the toyId for every toy that Rocky owns.
- Find the name of the owner for every toy.</code></pre>
