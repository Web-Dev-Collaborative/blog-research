<h2 id="assessment-structure">Assessment Structure</h2>
<ul>
<li>2 hours, 55 minutes</li>
<li>Mixture of multiple choice (5-10), free response (1-3) and VSCode problems (40ish specs).
<ul>
<li>Free response just requires enough detail to answer the question, 1-3 sentences. As long as you are able to explain the concept and answer all aspects that it asks, you are good.</li>
<li>Coding problems come in two varieties:
<ul>
<li>Writing raw SQL like the projects from Tuesday to create tables, insert values, query for records, join tables for queries, etc.</li>
<li>Using sequelize to perform actions such as creating migrations, models, seeders, and then interacting with those models to query for, create, modify, delete, etc.</li>
<li>Both of these sections have their own practice assessment</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Standard assessment procedures
<ul>
<li>You will be in an individual breakout room</li>
<li>Use a single monitor and share your screen</li>
<li>Only have open those resources needed to complete the assessment:
<ul>
<li>Zoom</li>
<li>VSCode</li>
<li>Browser with AAO and Progress Tracker (to ask questions)</li>
<li>Approved Resources for this assessment:
<ul>
<li>Postgres Docs: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/</li>
<li>Sequelize Docs: https://sequelize.org/</li>
<li>Sequelize “Cheatsheet”</li>
