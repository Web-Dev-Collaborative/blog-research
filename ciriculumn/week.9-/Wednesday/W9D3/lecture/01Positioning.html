<h4 id="static">1. Static:</h4>
<p>This is the default for a box-model element (not actually positioned) #### 2. Relative The element’s position can be adjusted relative to its original location. #### 3. Absolute The rest of the page’s elements do not affect this one. It is positioned based on the location of its nearest ancestor <strong>that is also positioned</strong> (ex: relative, absolute, fixed). If it can’t find one, it is positioned relative to the <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> document. #### 4. Fixed The element is flying solo. It’s position is relative to the viewport and unaffected by other elements. #### 5. Sticky Element is relative until a condition is met. Then it becomes fixed to a page.</p>
