<h2 id="what-is-bem">What is BEM?</h2>
<p>BEM is a naming convention for CSS classes that gives meaningful, specific, and maintainable class names. Quite often, we can have a webpage with a lot of HTML and it can be quite difficult to find appropriate CSS class names.</p>
<p>In the BEM model, a CSS class can be broken down into at most three parts: * Block * Element * Modifier</p>
<p>By using BEM, we are able to keep all styles at the same level of specificity, with no style overriding the other due to being a higher level of specifity.</p>
<p>However, not all three parts must be present in the class name.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-blocks-elements-and-modifiers">What are blocks, elements and modifiers?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Block: A standalone entity that is meaningful on its own.
<ul>
<li>Ex: header, container, menu, navbar, input</li>
<li>Its name can contain latin letters, digits, dashes</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Element: A part of a block. It has no meaning on its own
<ul>
<li>Any DOM node can be a block if it accepts a class name.</li>
<li>Any element is semantically tied to its block.</li>
<li>Within a given block, all elements are semantically equal.</li>
<li>Ex: menu item, list-item, header title, input label</li>
<li>Its name can contain latin letters, digits, dashes, underscore</li>
<li>The CSS class is formed by using first the block name, plus two underscores, plus the element name: <code>.block__element</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Modifier: A flag on a block or element used to change appearance or behavior
<ul>
<li>Ex: disabled, color yellow, size big, fixed</li>
<li>Modifier is an extra class name which you add to a block/element DOM node.(Examples: <code>.button--active</code>, .<code>button__textarea--red</code>)</li>
<li>Add modifier classes only to blocks/elements they modify, and keep the original class (e.g. keep the class <code>.button</code> and add <code>.button--active</code>).</li>
<li>The CSS class is formed as block’s or element’s name plus two dashes: <code>.block--mod</code> OR <code>.block__element--mod</code> AND .<code>block--color-red</code>. (Spaces in complicated modifiers are replaced by dash.)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
