<ol type="1">
<li><p>Case Study- video then lecture</p></li>
<li><p>recursiveCallStck- video then lecture. Show external resource https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/RecFact.html</p></li>
<li><p>Remaining videos: Walk through and solve the problems with students then have them watch the videos after. Save flatten for the last video.</p></li>

<ul>
<li>Suggested method of solving recursive problems with students during lecture:
<ul>
<li>Focus on identifying patterns and where there is a break in the pattern or the pattern changes.</li>
<li>Identify the base case, recursive case, and recursive step.</li>
<li>Establish a plan to solve the problem before writing any code.</li>
<li>Fill out the comments at the bottom of the page with corresponding values before invoking the function.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Have a plan before writing any code</p></li>
<li><p>Use as many visual aids as possible. Ex: external resource at the top of the page. Open same file side by side as a new recursive call is made, showing the new values. Close the tabs as the stacks resolve.</p></li>
</ul>
