<h2 id="the-way-of-the-shell">The Way of the Shell</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>In computing, a shell is a user interface for access to an operating system’s services. In general, operating system shells use either a command-line interface (CLI) or graphical user interface (GUI), depending on a computer’s role and particular operation. It is named a shell because it is the outermost layer around the operating system.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>— <em>Wikipedia, “Shell (computing)”</em></p>
<p><em>In the beginning of computers that could run programs as we understand them, there was the shell.</em></p>
<p>The <strong>Thompson Shell</strong> (1971) was the first Unix shell and offered a new approach to input and output redirection. Following in this tradition, every program starts with a standard input and output file (<code>0</code> and <code>1</code>, respectively); by default these files are tied to the console, but they can be redirected from (<code>&lt;</code>) or to (<code>&gt;</code>) the file system using this syntax:</p>
<pre><code>my_program &lt; my_input_file &gt; my_output_file</code></pre>
<p>programs can also be chained together using the pipe character (<code>|</code>):</p>
<pre><code>my_analysis_program &lt; my_data | my_filter | my_report_generator &gt; my_report</code></pre>
<p>The <strong>Bourne Shell</strong> (1979) added the use of file descriptor 2 for error messages. This shell kept the same program name as its predecessor, and can still be invoked on most Linux systems as <code>/bin/sh</code>.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> These three standard file handles - input <code>(0)</code>, output <code>(1)</code>, and errors or logging <code>(2)</code> - are associated with any program you will run that interacts with the shell. In particular, you may remember the <em>input</em> (<code>process.stdin</code>) and <em>output</em> (<code>process.stdout</code>) attributes associated with the call to <code>readline.createInterface()</code> from the lessons on the <code>readline</code> module.</p>
<p>On most Linux systems and the Mac OS each user has a particular default shell; other shells will generally either already be available or easily installed. Three notable more recent widely used shells are the <strong>Korn Shell</strong> (<code>ksh</code>, 1983) <em>(some Linux servers)</em>, the <strong>Bourne-Again Shell</strong> (<code>bash</code>, 1989) <em>(most Linux workstations and many servers)</em>, and the <strong>Z Shell</strong> (<code>zsh</code>, 1990) <em>(Mac OS Catalina)</em>.</p>
<p>(<strong>COMMAND.COM</strong>, <strong>CMD.EXE</strong> and <strong>POWERSHELL</strong> are all Microsoft shells with some similarities to the UNIX-style shells discussed; they will not be discussed further here)</p>
<h2 id="graphs-nodes-edges-trees-forests">Graphs, Nodes, Edges, Trees &amp; Forests</h2>
<p>Later on, we will explore a variety of data structures in some detail - but at this point it may help to have some vocabulary that relates directly to how file systems are organized. Via Wikipedia: &gt;In mathematics, and more specifically in graph theory, a graph is a structure amounting to a set of objects in which some pairs of the objects are in some sense “related”. The objects correspond to mathematical abstractions called vertices (also called <strong>nodes</strong> or points) and each of the related pairs of vertices is called an <strong>edge</strong> (also called link or line). Typically, a graph is depicted in diagrammatic form as a set of dots or circles for the vertices, joined by lines or curves for the edges.<br />
&gt;Edges may be directed or undirected. … The former type of graph is called an <em>undirected</em> graph while the latter type of graph is called a <em>directed</em> graph.</p>
<p>From the same article, a <strong>tree</strong> is defined as a <em>graph</em> where any two <em>nodes</em> are connected by exactly one <strong>path</strong>. A tree will have exactly one <strong>root</strong> node; the file system on UNIX (Linux/Mac OS) computers is a tree rooted on the <code>/</code> folder. In contrast, a <strong>forest</strong> is a disjoint collection of trees; the Windows file system is a forest with each tree rooted on a physical or virtual device. (<code>C:\</code>, <code>D:\</code> etc)</p>
<h2 id="unix-linux-file-systems-in-general">UNIX / Linux File Systems In General</h2>
<p>The <em>nodes</em> in the UNIX file system are <strong>files</strong>, which are themselves an ordered sequence of zero or more bytes (binary files) or characters (text files). One special type of (binary) <em>file</em> is the <strong>directory</strong>, which is a file that holds a list of other files. The <strong><em>path</em></strong> for any file is the sequence of directories from some starting point to the file itself; <strong>absolute</strong> paths start with the root directory (<code>/etc/hosts</code>); while <strong>relative</strong> paths start anywhere else. (<em>this</em> file is currently <code>Documents/Curricula/2020-may/shell.md</code>, starting from my home directory)</p>

<ul>
<li><strong><code>&lt; | &gt; &gt;&gt;</code></strong> - (file redirection) - <code>&lt; &lt;file&gt;</code> redirects the standard input stream to read from a file; <code>&gt; &lt;file&gt;</code> redirects the standard output stream into a new file; <code>&gt;&gt; &lt;file&gt;</code> redirects the standard output stream into a file, appending if the file already exists. NOTE: a common redirection pattern is <code>2&gt;&amp;1</code>, which means ‘direct the stderr stream (<code>2</code>) to the same stream as stdout (<code>1</code>).

<p><em>(There are more - this is just to get you started!)</em></p>
<h2 id="wednesday-lecture-notes">Wednesday Lecture Notes</h2>
<h3 id="navigation">Navigation</h3>
<p>What is a path? A series of directories, separated by slashes. You can see the directory you are in by typing the command <code>pwd</code>.</p>
<p>What is a home directory? Every regular user has a personal storage space - on Linux it is typically <code>/home/&lt;user&gt;</code>; on Mac OS it is <code>/Users/&lt;user&gt;</code></p>
<p>What is the difference between an <em>absolute</em> path and a <em>relative</em> path? An absolute path starts at the root direcory, and so begins with a slash.</p>
<p>How does one navigate the file system? The <code>cd</code> command allows one to change to a new directory; tab completion can be used to speed this process up dramatically. Special directories often used in navigation and locating files are <code>~</code> (the user’s home directory), <code>.</code> (the current directory), and <code>..</code> (the parent of the current directory).</p>
<p>You can make a new directory with the <code>mkdir</code> command; this command creates directories under the current one, and can make several directories at once - as in Alex’s example: <code>mkdir assets scripts styles</code>.</p>
<p><code>touch</code> is a simple command to update the access time on a file; <code>touch &lt;file&gt;</code> “touches” the file. <code>touch</code> will create an empty file if the named file does not exist.</p>
<p><code>cp</code> (copy) and <code>mv</code> (move) will copy and move-or-rename files, respectively. (Because all files have a unique path including their name, moving a file is the same as renaming it).</p>
<p><code>ls</code> (list) is a command you will know well - <code>ls</code> lists the contents of one or more folders. Commonly used options are <code>-l</code> (list or detailed format), <code>-a</code> (<em>all files</em>, including hidden ones), and <code>-h</code> (human-readable file sizes).</p>
<p>NOTE: single character options like these are called <strong>flags</strong> - they are two-state (Boolean) values, and can usually be combined by running them together, thus <code>ls -lha</code>.</p>
<p>Files that start with a period (or only are a period!) are <em>hidden</em>, which is to say not displayed when ls is invoked without the <code>-a</code> option. The example Alex gave was the file he created with the command <code>touch assets/.keep</code>, in order to force <code>git</code> to include the <code>assets</code> directory in his repository.</p>
<p>The <code>rm</code> command removes files. (and directories, with the proper options). Unlike in the GUI shell, there is no recycle bin for deleted files, so be very careful using the <code>rm</code> command. Similarly, the <code>rmdir</code> command deletes empty directories; while not as generally useful as <code>rm</code> it is less likely to be involved in a file system accident.</p>
<h3 id="common-tasks">Common Tasks</h3>
<p>In this lecture, Alex demonstrated <code>curl</code> - the “Client URL” tool - that copies the document fetched from a URL to the stdout stream. You can use the <code>-o</code> option to redirect the output of <code>curl</code> to a file.</p>
<p>He also demonstrated the <code>grep</code> command. <code>grep</code> is a powerful general-purpose search tool. (The name is short for <code>g/re/p</code>, which means <em>“global regular expression print”</em>)</p>
<p>A really important point he made was the use of the <code>man</code> pages - by typing <code>man grep</code> you can access extensive documentation about the <code>grep</code> command, and this same feature documents most shell commands. The navigation commands within the <code>man</code> program are the same as in <code>less</code> (a pagination tool / document reader) and <code>vi</code> (a commonly used, older editor) - <code>/&lt;string&gt;</code> searches for the next occurance of <em>&lt;string&gt;</em>, <code>n</code> repeats the last search, <code>N</code> reverses the search, using <code>?</code> instead of <code>/</code> searches backwards, and <code>q</code> gets you out of the program.</p>
<p>Alex used the pipe operator (<code>|</code>) to run grep on the output of a program; the pipe operator in general allows you to route the output of one program into the input of another.</p>
<p>Alex demonstrated the <code>nano</code> editor - this text editor is generally available on all modern shells and is relatively easy to use compared to older alternatives like <code>vi / vim</code> and <code>emacs</code>.</p>
<p>Finally, he demonstrated the <code>diff</code> command, which like the <code>git diff</code> command, displays the differences between two files.</p>
<p>(For global search-and-replace tasks, <code>sed</code> and <code>awk</code> are commonly available, and often used)</p>
<h3 id="shell-basics">Shell Basics</h3>
<p>In this lecture, Alex instroduced the <code>bash</code> shell, as the default shell on the Mac OS. (This has changed with the release of <em>catalina</em>; the default shell on Mac OS is now <code>zsh</code>)</p>
<p>NOTE: In general, users of modern UNIX-flavored OS’s (Linux, Mac OS, WSL on Windows) have their choice of shells. <code>ksh</code>, <code>bash</code> and <code>zsh</code> are all in common use and offer similar functionality. They all have strong points and strong advocates, and are in practice mostly capable of the same things.</p>
<p>Alex mentioned the <code>$PATH</code> variable. This is an environmental variable which documents the directories to be searched (in order) to find an executable file to run. He also mentioned the <code>which</code> command, which will search the <code>$PATH</code> for matches on a given program’s name.</p>
<p>Special attention was given to the <code>bash</code> user files, <code>.bash_profile</code> and <code>.bashrc</code>. (The <code>zsh</code> shell has similar files, most notably, <code>.zshrc</code>) These files load scripted functions and varibles into the <strong><em>environment</em></strong>, which provides configurable resources to scripts and other programs at run-time. As per the video:</p>
<p><code>.bash_profile</code>: on Linux this file is loaded only on login. (on Mac OS it was loaded for every new terminal instance) <code>.bashrc</code>: on Linux, this file is loaded for every new terminal instance. (on the Mac OS it only is loaded when explicit new <code>bash</code> shell is started)</p>
<p>NOTE: Users running Ubuntu under WSL on Windows will not have a <code>.bash_profile</code> script. This is (presumably) because you are already logged in on Windows, so there is no additional login script to run; in this case, put your customized shell settings in <code>.bashrc</code>.</p>
<p>Alex mentioned <code>aliases</code>, which are short-cuts used to shorten commands and to provide default options - these are generally user-customized.</p>
<h3 id="shell-scripting">Shell Scripting</h3>
<p>In the last video, Alex introduced shell scripts proper. He mentions that each generally starts with a “shebang” (<code>#! /&lt;path_to_interpreter&gt;</code>), which tells the shell which interpreter to use to run the script.</p>
<p>He noted that files by default are not executable, and so to make them runnable one must use the <code>chmod</code> command, as in <code>chmod +x &lt;script async&gt;</code>. He also demonstrated the <code>echo</code> command, which writes strings to the stdout stream, the <code>$USER</code> environmental variable, which is the current user’s name, and the <code>whoami</code> command, which accesses this variable.</p>
<h2 id="deep-resources-for-further-study">Deep Resources for Further Study</h2>
<p>For Free and Open Source Software (FOSS), good* documentation is generally part of the package. In order to make the most of these resources, one has to spend some time to get to know them; you might want to download one or more of these reference guides for the shell or shells you most commonly use - all this will make more sense the more you use it!</p>
