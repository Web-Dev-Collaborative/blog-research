<p>We want to write a dog class which will do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>instances should have a <code>name</code> property which is set when the instance is created.</p></li>
<li><p>have an instance method called <code>bark</code> which returns a string formatted as <code>"${this.name} is barking"</code></p></li>
<li><p>have an instance method <code>chainChaseTail</code> which takes a number and calls the helper method <code>chaseTail</code> that number of times. When given an argument that is not a number, <code>chainChaseTail</code> should throw a <code>TypeError</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>a class method <code>cleanPaws</code> which takes an array of dogs and returns an array where each element of the array is a string formatted as <code>I cleaned "${this.name}'s paws</code></p></li>
</ul>
