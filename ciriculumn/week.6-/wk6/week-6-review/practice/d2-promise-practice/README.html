<p>Inside this directory you will find two sub-directories (<code>solution</code>, <code>your-code</code>) - write your solutions to the problems listed below in the <code>your-code</code> directory - check your solutions against those I’ve provided in the <code>solution</code> directory</p>
<h2 id="problem-1-your-codeproblem_1.js">Problem #1 (<code>your-code/problem_1.js</code>)</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>TODO: write a function called stretch</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>should return a promise</li>
<li>should console.log “done stretching” and fulfill the promise after 1 second</li>

<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>TODO: write a function called runOnTreadmill</li>

<ul>
<li>should return a promise</li>
<li>should console.log “done running on treadmill” and fulfill the promise after 0.5 seconds</li>

<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>TODO: write a function called liftWeights</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>should return a promise</li>
<li>should console.log “done lifting weights” and fulfill the promise after 2 seconds</li>
</ul>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>TODO: write a function called workout that runs the above functions in a way that ensures you begin runningOnTreadmill after you’re finished stretching, you begin liftWeights after you’ve finished running on the treadmill and console.logs “done working out” after you’ve finished lifting weights</li>
</ol>
<p>TESTING - run the file (<code>node problem_1.js</code>) and check your output against the expected output I’ve provided at the bottom of the file</p>
<h2 id="problem-2-your-codeproblem_2.js">Problem #2 (<code>your-code/problem_2.js</code>)</h2>
<p>lets improve upon problem #1</p>
<p>adjust your workout function so that it takes in a specific amount of time that you have available for the entire workout</p>
<p>given the following rules, have each promise resolve with the amount of time left by decrementing each action by its specific amount of time</p>
<p>rules: 1. you must stretch for 1 second 2. you must run on treadmill for 0.5 seconds 3. you must lift weights for 2 seconds</p>
<p>if the time needed to complete the current action exceeds the amount of time left, reject the promise and provide a reason</p>
<p>workout(500); // “Error: you dont have enough time to stretch” - if we only have 0.5 seconds to workout, we wont even have enough time to stretch</p>
<p>TODO: recreate the functions from problem #1 to reflect this new functionality</p>
<p>TESTING: - comment in each invocation of the workout function listed at the bottom and run the file (<code>node problem_2.js</code>) to see if you get the expected output</p>
