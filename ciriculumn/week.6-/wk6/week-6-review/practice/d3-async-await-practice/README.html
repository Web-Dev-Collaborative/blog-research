<h1 id="async-await-practice">ASYNC / AWAIT PRACTICE</h1>
<p>Inside this directory you will find two sub-directories (<code>solution</code>, <code>your-code</code>) - write your solutions to the problems listed below in the <code>your-code</code> directory - check your solutions against those I’ve provided in the <code>solution</code> directory</p>
<h2 id="problem-1-your-codeproblem_1.js">Problem #1 (<code>your-code/problem_1.js</code>)</h2>
<p>TODO: use <code>async</code> &amp; <code>await</code> to create a function called <code>workout</code> that runs the given functions in a way that ensures you begin runningOnTreadmill after you’re finished stretching, you begin liftWeights after you’ve finished running on the treadmill and console.logs “done working out” after you’ve finished lifting weights</p>
<p>TESTING - run the file (<code>node problem_1.js</code>) and check your output against the expected output I’ve provided at the bottom of the file</p>
<h2 id="problem-2-your-codeproblem_2.js">Problem #2 (<code>your-code/problem_2.js</code>)</h2>
<p>TODO: recreate the solution to problem #2 in your promise practice using async and await</p>
<p>TESTING: - comment in each invocation of the workout function listed at the bottom and run the file (<code>node problem_2.js</code>) to see if you get the expected output</p>
