    "body": "# Debugging A Stack Overflow\n\nUh oh! We've written a recursive function, but it's throwing an error! \nInvestigate the included problem and see if you can figure out what's going on.\n\nOnce you think you've fixed the issue, use `mocha` to confirm. Make sure\nyou're in the project's root: you should be in the same place as the `problems/`\nand `test/` directories. Once there, run the following command:\n\n```sh\n> mocha\n```\n\nIf you get stuck, step back and try breaking the problem down. Are we missing \nany key steps for a recursive function?\n\nWhen the tests pass and the error is gone, take a minute to celebrate - you're \nofficially a recursion debugger!\n"
