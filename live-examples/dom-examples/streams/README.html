<p>Examples: * <a href="http://mdn.github.io/dom-examples/streams/simple-pump/">Simple stream pump</a>: This example shows how to consume a ReadableStream and pass its data to another. * <a href="http://mdn.github.io/dom-examples/streams/grayscale-png/">Grayscale a PNG</a>: This example shows how a ReadableStream of a PNG can be turned into grayscale. * <a href="http://mdn.github.io/dom-examples/streams/simple-random-stream/">Simple random stream</a>: This example shows how to use a custom stream to generate random strings, enqueue them as chunks, and then read them back out again. * <a href="http://mdn.github.io/dom-examples/streams/simple-tee-example/">Simple tee example</a>: This example extends the Simple random stream example, showing how a stream can be teed and both resulting streams can be read independently. * <a href="http://mdn.github.io/dom-examples/streams/simple-writer/">Simple writer</a>: This example shows how to to write to a writable stream, then decode the stream and write the contents to the UI. * <a href="http://mdn.github.io/dom-examples/streams/strings-transform-stream/">Transform binary chunks to strings</a>: In this example, binary data chunks of a text file are converted to string lines by a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/TransformStream"><code>TransformStream</code></a>. * <a href="http://mdn.github.io/dom-examples/streams/png-transform-stream/">Unpack chunks of a PNG</a>: This example shows how <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ReadableStream/pipeThrough"><code>pipeThrough()</code></a> can be used to transform a ReadableStream into a stream of other data types by transforming a data of a PNG file into a stream of PNG chunks.</p>
