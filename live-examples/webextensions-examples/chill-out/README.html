<p>After 6 seconds of inactivity (defined as the user not having navigated or switched away from the active tab) display a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/pageAction">page action</a> for that tab.</p>
<p>When the user clicks the page action, navigate to https://giphy.com/explore/cat.</p>
<p>The delay of 6 seconds is to make the extension’s behavior obvious, but such a short period is not recommended in practical applications. Note that in Chrome, alarms do not fire in under a minute. In Chrome:</p>
<ul>
<li>if you install this extension “unpacked”, you’ll see a warning in the console, but the alarm will still go off after 6 seconds</li>
<li>if you package the extension and install it, then the alarm will go off after a minute.</li>
</ul>

<p>How to:</p>
<ul>

<li>show and hide a page action.</li>

</ul>
