<h2 id="what-it-does">What it does</h2>
<p>This extension uses the proxy API listener <code>onRequest</code> to listen for requests to visit a web page, compare the webpage’s domain with a blocked host list, and proxy domains on the blocked list to 127.0.0.1.</p>
<p>The list of blocked domains is held in local storage and given the initial value <code>["example.com", "example.org"]</code> when the extension installs. The list can be modified through the extension"s options page.</p>
<p>Note that the hostname-matching is simple: hostnames must match an entry in the list if they are to be blocked. So with the default settings, “example.org” is blocked but “www.example.org” is permitted.</p>
<p>To try out this extension: * install it * visit <code>http://example.com</code> and see it is blocked * visit <code>about:addons</code>, open the add-on’s preferences, and change the hostnames in the text box * visit some pages to see the effect of your changes.</p>
