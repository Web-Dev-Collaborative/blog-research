<h2 id="what-it-does">What it does</h2>
<p>This add-on sets the default client for opening IRC links using <code>protocol_handlers</code>.</p>
<p>Whenever a link using the IRC protocol is clicked, the link is opened in the URI defined in the add-on’s manifest. In this example, all IRC protocol links are opened in mibbit.com.<br />
For example, once you’ve installed the extension, click this link <a href="irc://irc.freenode.net/drupal">irc://irc.freenode.net/drupal</a> and the protocol handler opens the Drupal channel in mibbit.com.</p>
