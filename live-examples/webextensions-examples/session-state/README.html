<h2 id="what-it-does">What it does</h2>
<p>This extension adds a context menu item. When the user clicks the context menu item, the extension adds a border to the page.</p>
<p>But the extension also uses <code>sessions.setTabValue</code> to store the fact that it has added a border to this page. If the user closes the page, then restores it, the extension will retrieve this fact using <code>sessions.getTabValue</code>, and use that to reapply the border.</p>
<p>Note: to restore a tab, press Control+Shift+T (or Command+Shift+T on a Mac). In Firefox you can also restore the tab from your “History-&gt;Recently Closed Tabs” menu.</p>
<h2 id="what-it-shows">What it shows</h2>
<p>This example demonstrates how you can use the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/sessions">sessions</a> API to store and retrieve arbitrary state that you want to associate with a tab or window. Then if the tab/window is closed and subsequently restored, you can retrieve the state.</p>
