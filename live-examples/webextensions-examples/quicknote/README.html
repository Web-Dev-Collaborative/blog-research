<h1 id="quicknote">Quicknote</h1>
<p>A persistent note/to-do list application — click a button in your browser and record notes, which will persist even after browser restarts.</p>
<p>Works in Firefox 47+.</p>
<h2 id="running-with-web-ext">Running with web-ext</h2>
<p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions">web-ext</a> generates a new profile on each run, meaning your data is not persisted between Firefox runs. To use web-ext and preserve this information, you will need an existing or new Firefox profile. Then run:</p>
<p>web-ext run –firefox-profile [A PATH TO A FIREFOX PROFILE] –keep-profile-changes</p>
