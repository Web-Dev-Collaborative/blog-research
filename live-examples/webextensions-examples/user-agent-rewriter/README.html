<h2 id="what-it-does">What it does</h2>
<p>This extension uses the webRequest API to rewrite the browser’s User Agent header, but only when visiting pages under “https://httpbin.org”, for example: https://httpbin.org/user-agent</p>
<p>It adds a browser action. The browser action has a popup that lets the user choose one of three browsers: Firefox 41, Chrome 41, and IE 11. When the user chooses a browser, the extension then rewrites the User Agent header so the real browser identifies itself as the chosen browser on the site https://httpbin.org/.</p>
