<ul>
<li>a sidebar including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</li>
<li>a content script</li>
<li>a web page template, packaged as web accessible resources</li>
</ul>
<p>When the extension loads the user is offered a file picker and drop zone as methods to choose an image file.</p>
<p>Once an image file has been chosen, the extension injects the content script into the active tab, and sends the content script a message containing the URL of the chosen image.</p>
<p>When the content script receives this message, it replaces the current page content with the chosen image file.</p>
