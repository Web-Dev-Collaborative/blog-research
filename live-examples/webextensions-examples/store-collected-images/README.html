<h2 id="what-it-does">What it does</h2>
<p>This example adds a context menu which targets any image element in the webpage. When the context menu item is clicked, the add-on opens a window and adds the related image element to the preview list of the collected images. The user can then store the collected images by giving the collection a name and pressing the <strong>save</strong> button.</p>
<p>Once a collection of reference images has been stored by the add-on, they can be navigated using the extension page that the add-on will open in a tab when the user press the add-on <strong>browserAction</strong>.</p>

<p>The main goal of this example is showing how to use the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/idb-file-storage">idb-file-storage library</a> to store and manipulate files in a WebExtension.</p>
<ul>
<li>How to store blob into the add-on IndexedDB storage</li>
<li>How to list the stored blobs (optionally by filtering the listed blobs)</li>
<li>How to turn the stored blobs into blob urls to show them in the extension page</li>
<li>How to remove the stored blobs from the extension IndexedDB storage.</li>

<p>This example is written in two forms:</p>
<ul>
<li>a plain webextension (which doesn’t need any build step)</li>
<li>a webextension built using webpack</li>
</ul>
<p>The code that stores and retrieves the files from the IndexedDB storage is in the file named <code>utils/image-store.js</code> in both the example version.</p>
