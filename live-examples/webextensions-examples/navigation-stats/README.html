<p>The extension includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>a background which collects navigation stats using the webNavigation API, and store the stats using the storage API.</li>
<li>a browser action with a popup including HTML, CSS, and JS, which renders the stats stored by the background page</li>
</ul>
<p>When the user navigate on a website from any of the browser tabs, the background page collected every completed navigation with the “http” or “https” schemes (using an UrlFilter for the listener of the webNavigation events)</p>
<p>When the user clicks the browser action button, the popup is shown, and the stats saved using the storage API are retrived and rendered in the popup window.</p>
<h2 id="what-it-shows">What it shows</h2>
<ul>
<li>use the webNavigation API to monitor browsing navigation events</li>
<li>use an UrlFilter to only receive the webNavigation event using one of the supported criteria.</li>
<li>use the storage API to persist data over browser reboots and to share it between different extension pages.</li>
</ul>
